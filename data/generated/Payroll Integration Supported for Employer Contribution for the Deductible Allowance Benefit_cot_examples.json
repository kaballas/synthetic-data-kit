It then maps how SAP Employee Central and Employee Central Payroll integrate to manage these contributions\u2014covering data flows, wage types, replication, payroll schema configuration, validations, and reconciliation\u2014and outlines common challenges (multi-jurisdiction compliance, mapping, timing) plus SAP best practices (use standard content, thorough testing, monitoring, and documentation).",

Create distinct wage types for each semantic category.\nStep 3: Create mapping matrix \u2014 for each EC field (amount, effective date, benefit type, country) map to the appropriate ECP wage type(s).
