  "summary": "The \"My Workflow Requests\" page in SAP Employee Central centralizes pending HR workflow tasks, allowing users to view, filter, and act on requests (approve, decline, reassign) with quick access to key details to streamline decision-making. Recent enhancements add deep links and global header search access, reducing navigation friction and speeding approvals, while relying on REST/OData, URL routing, and search integration to fetch user-specific workflow data. These improvements boost automation efficiency and visibility but require strict role-based controls, secure authentication, auditing, and user education to mitigate privacy and compliance risks.",
