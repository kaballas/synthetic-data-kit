  "summary": "The document summarizes research on the deprecation of the \"Copy User\" feature in SAP SuccessFactors Learning, explaining it as a legacy Plateau-era function used to duplicate user profiles and assignments that is technically incompatible with the modern platform. It notes SAP's End of Development announcement (June 2, 2023) and planned deletion (Nov 15, 2025), and recommends moving to Identity Provisioning and API-based user management while assessing operational impacts and transition best practices.",
