  "summary": "**Summary**\n\nSAP Employee Central Compensation is a SuccessFactors module that centralizes pay structures, recurring and one\u2011time pay components, workflows, and compliance for global payroll and HR processes while integrating tightly with Employee Central for master data and approvals. Recent 2024\u20132025 enhancements add improved UX, AI-assisted insights (Joule), richer analytics and pay\u2011equity KPIs, scalable data architecture, stronger localization and security, and tighter payroll integration\u2014collectively enabling more data\u2011driven, compliant compensation decisions with measurable impacts on fairness, efficiency, and retention (subject to proper validation and testing).",
