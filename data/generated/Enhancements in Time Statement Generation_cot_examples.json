  "summary": "The Time Statement Generation feature in SAP Time Tracking lets employees self\u2011service generate, preview, download, and email PDF time statements (showing recorded hours, absences, overtime, premiums and valuation results) using configurable templates integrated with Employee Central and Document Generation. Recent H2 2024 enhancements add ESS generation, richer template options (Duration, Clock Time, Flex Time), preview mode, attestation text, previous\u2011value display during amendments, and tighter navigation/integration, improving accuracy, compliance, and usability. While these changes reduce administrative overhead and disputes and strengthen SAP\u2019s competitive position, they introduce moderate configuration and integration complexity that benefits from thorough testing and consultancy.",
