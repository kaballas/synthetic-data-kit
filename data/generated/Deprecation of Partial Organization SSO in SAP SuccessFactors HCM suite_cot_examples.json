  "summary": "Partial Organization SSO in SAP SuccessFactors lets some users authenticate via a corporate IdP (SSO/SAML) while others use credentials managed in the SuccessFactors Identity Authentication tenant, enabling mixed access scenarios (e.g., employees vs. contractors). SAP plans end of maintenance on 2025-05-16 and permanent removal on 2026-11-13, citing security, compliance, and operational risks from dual authentication flows. Organizations are advised to migrate to SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication) using SAML/OAuth/OpenID Connect with staged testing, conditional-auth configurations, and user communications to manage technical and operational challenges.",
