  "summary": "The document reports that initial search results are a useful starting point but insufficient for detailed answers, and it defines a focused multi-query search plan covering technical frameworks, UI design, permissions/business rules, data integrity, accessibility, performance, security, testing, productivity studies, and a SAP ATS comparison. The synthesized findings (partial) note common front-end stacks and drag\u2011and\u2011drop libraries, Kanban-style UI patterns with automation and feedback, bulk actions/undo, and the need for tightly governed RBAC/ABAC permissions and business rules (the synthesis cuts off mid\u2011discussion).",
