  "summary": "The research shows SAP SuccessFactors mobile now includes an in-app Language Settings screen allowing users to change language preferences directly, with automatic synchronization to backend and web profiles using shared language packs and role-based permissions. Next steps are to investigate mobile i18n best practices, detailed UX implications, technical frameworks/APIs and security/performance specifics, known limitations and patches, platform comparisons, and empirical adoption/engagement data.",
