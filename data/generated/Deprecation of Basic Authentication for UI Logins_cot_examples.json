  "summary": "This document describes a structured research and migration plan to analyze SAP SuccessFactors basic authentication (mechanics, vulnerabilities) and SAP\u2019s deprecation policy/timelines, then evaluate SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication) and recommended migration strategies. It summarizes Identity Authentication features (SAML/OIDC/OAuth2, MFA, token-based auth), migration risks, compliance and monitoring considerations, and aims to produce a detailed, actionable roadmap with risk analysis to meet SAP deadlines (end of support May 16, 2025; mandatory migration by Nov 13, 2026).",
