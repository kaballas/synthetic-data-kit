  "summary": "The document summarizes SAP SuccessFactors\u2019 legacy Goal Management as a configurable goal-planning and tracking system used by HR administrators, managers, and employees to create, align, and measure individual and group/team goals (templates, SMART goals, weights, tasks) and integrate with performance and succession processes. SAP released a redesigned latest Goal Management (GA H1 2023) with a new data model, improved UI, integrations, continuous feedback, and reporting, and announced deprecation of the legacy system (end of development 17 Nov 2023, end of maintenance 17 May 2024, removal 31 Dec 2026) to modernize capabilities and simplify the platform.",

      "question": "Given SAP\u2019s published dates (End of Development: 2023-11-17, End of Maintenance: 2024-05-17, Deletion/Removal: 2026-12-31), what is the latest safe cutoff date to complete a full migration from legacy Goal Management to the latest Goal Management to avoid service disruption, and what minimum project lead time should be planned when accounting for auditing, template conversion, testing, and user training?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will use to generate the example:\n- Identify hard deadline from SAP documentation.\n- Enumerate required migration activities and estimate conservative durations.\n- Aggregate durations to compute minimum lead time and derive a latest safe cutoff date.\n\nStep 1: Use the hard deletion date as the absolute deadline for production cutover: 2026-12-31. Step 2: List essential migration activities: audit & archive (including handling unsupported group goals), template conversion, data migration and integrity checks, integration and end-to-end testing, pilot rollouts, user training, and a buffer for rollback/issue remediation. Step 3: Assign conservative minimum durations to each activity based on industry best practice: audit & archive = 2\u20134 weeks, template conversion = 2\u20134 weeks, data migration + integrity checks = 3\u20136 weeks, integration & E2E testing = 4\u20138 weeks, pilot rollout = 2\u20134 weeks, user training & change management = 2\u20134 weeks, and contingency buffer = 2\u20134 weeks. Step 4: Sum the conservative lower bounds and realistic upper bounds to compute a minimum and recommended project duration. Step 5: Subtract the recommended project duration from the deletion date to compute the latest safe project start/cutover planning window to avoid disruption.\n\nConcise summary of calculation (conservative ranges): audit & archive (2\u20134w) + template conversion (2\u20134w) + data migration (3\u20136w) + integration & testing (4\u20138w) + pilot (2\u20134w) + training (2\u20134w) + buffer (2\u20134w) = minimum ~17 weeks (\u22484 months) to more realistic ~34 weeks (\u22488 months).",
      "answer": "Absolute deadline for production cutover: 2026-12-31. Minimum conservative project duration \u2248 4 months; realistic recommended duration \u2248 6\u20138 months. To be safe, plan to complete cutover at least 1 month before 2026-12-31 and start no later than early Q3 2026 for a 6\u2011month program (earlier if you have group-goal remediation or heavy integrations)."

      "question": "An organization has many active group goals in the legacy system but the latest Goal Management does not support group goals. What stepwise approach ensures data integrity, preserves auditability, and minimizes disruption to active performance cycles during migration?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will use to generate the example:\n- Identify the incompatibility and map affected objects.\n- Define preservation and remediation options for group goals.\n- Plan sequence: audit, archive/convert, test, and cutover with rollbacks.\n\nStep 1: Inventory all group goals and classify them by status (active, completed, historical), ownership (manager vs team), and downstream dependencies (linked performance forms, succession plans, reports). Step 2: For goals that must remain actionable, evaluate conversion strategies: recreate as team goals in the latest system, convert to individual goals with clear ownership, or migrate as read-only historical records. Step 3: For audit and compliance, export and archive full goal history and metadata (timestamps, editors, attachments) into an immutable audit store or archived SuccessFactors instance. Step 4: Prepare parallel templates in the new system that replicate required fields and metrics; where exact parity is impossible, document accepted deviations and compensating controls. Step 5: Run a pilot conversion on a representative subset (including linked performance forms) and validate data integrity, visibility, and reporting. Step 6: Communicate cutover plans and timelines to stakeholders and schedule migration between performance cycles if possible. Step 7: Execute migration with post-cutover validation, provide rollback procedures, and keep archived records accessible for audits.",
      "answer": "Perform an inventory and dependency mapping; archive full goal history for audit; convert actionable group goals to team or individual goals where needed; create parallel templates and run a pilot; schedule cutover between cycles; validate integrative flows and retain rollback and archived records to preserve data integrity and compliance."

      "question": "If a company wants to avoid mid-cycle disruption and must test integrations with Performance and Succession modules, what is an optimal sequencing and testing plan (including pilot size and test phases) to validate the latest Goal Management before full rollout?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will use to generate the example:\n- Define test objectives and required integrations.\n- Propose phased testing with representative pilot scope.\n- Specify test phases, validation criteria, and rollback conditions.\n\nStep 1: Define objectives: verify data mapping, integration points to Performance and Succession, goal lifecycle behavior, reporting, and user workflows. Step 2: Identify a representative pilot group (size and composition): include 2\u20133 business units, covering 50\u2013200 users depending on org size, with managers who have historically used group/team goals and IT resources for integrations.

Step 4: For each phase define acceptance criteria: successful sync of goals to performance forms, accurate history preservation, no data loss, reporting parity, and acceptable user feedback scores. Step 5: Maintain rollback criteria and a contingency window; if acceptance criteria fail, revert to legacy or delay cutover until fixes and retests are completed. Step 6: After successful pilot, schedule staged rollout (by organizational unit) with monitoring, targeted training, and post-rollout support.",
      "answer": "Use a phased test plan: sandbox alpha (2\u20134 weeks), controlled pilot with 50\u2013200 users (4\u20138 weeks), then full integration/E2E testing (3\u20136 weeks). Acceptance criteria must include correct integration with Performance and Succession, preserved history, and no data loss. Roll out in stages between performance cycles with a rollback contingency and active post-launch support."
