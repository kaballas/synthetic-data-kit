  "summary": "**Summary**\n\nThe document is a research plan and collected findings on SAP Opportunity Marketplace and the Manage Opportunity Marketplace admin tool, describing core capabilities (AI/ML-driven personalized recommendations, internal assignments, mentoring, learning and job matches) and administrator controls (enable/disable opportunity types, configure recommendation models, and manage landing-page sections). It notes that the redesign introduces a more intuitive UI with drag-and-drop layout, audience targeting, real-time preview/publishing, and recommends best practices such as aligning content to strategy, monitoring engagement analytics, pilot testing, and governance.",
