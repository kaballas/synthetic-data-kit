  "summary": "The document reviews SAP Employee Central event reason derivation for Job Information and Termination Details imports, describing how these settings auto-assign contextual event reasons and noting SAP's removal of three specific derivation settings along with the resulting technical and functional impacts on position management and downstream systems. It summarizes risks (data inconsistency, workflow and compliance disruptions) and recommended mitigations (impact assessment, rule updates or import-template pre-setting, thorough testing, phased rollout) plus alternative approaches and customer experience lessons for maintaining accuracy and integrations.",
