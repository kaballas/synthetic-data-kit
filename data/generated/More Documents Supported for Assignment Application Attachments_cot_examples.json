  "summary": "The report shows that SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace now explicitly supports PowerPoint (.ppt/.pptx) and Excel (.xls/.xlsx) attachments (as of 2025), enabling richer candidate materials that are integrated into AI-driven recommendation and preview workflows. It also summarizes technical and security controls (file size limits, encryption, malware scanning, audit logs), common user benefits and challenges (better expressiveness vs. size/format issues), system integration points, and practical best practices for preparing and uploading files.",

      "question": "An applicant has a 70MB .pptx (many high-resolution images) and a 45MB .xlsx (large data tables). The platform enforces a 50MB per-file limit and a 100MB total-per-application cap. What concrete steps should the applicant take to prepare both files so they can upload both attachments while preserving essential content, and what are realistic post-optimization sizes?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify constraints: per-file \u2264 50MB; total \u2264 100MB.\n- Inspect file contents to locate largest contributors (images, embedded media, hidden data).\n- Apply targeted optimizations for PPTX and XLSX.\n- Estimate expected size reductions and verify final sizes against limits.\n\nStep 1: Confirm limits and initial totals: PPTX 70MB (>50MB), XLSX 45MB (\u226450MB), combined 115MB (>100MB) so both cannot upload as-is.\nStep 2: Optimize PPTX: remove unused slides, compress and downscale images (e.g., 150\u2013220 DPI), convert embedded videos to links or remove, use PowerPoint\u2019s media compression at 70\u201380% quality. Typical realistic reduction for image-heavy decks \u2248 35\u201345%.\nStep 3: Optimize XLSX: remove hidden/unused sheets, delete unnecessary pivot caches, strip embedded snapshots, convert raw data to summarized tables or link to external datasets, save as compressed .xlsx. Typical realistic reduction for bloated spreadsheets \u2248 25\u201335%.\nStep 4: Apply optimizations and estimate sizes: assume PPTX reduced by 40% \u2192 42MB; XLSX reduced by 30% \u2192 31.5MB. Recompute total: 42 + 31.5 = 73.5MB, both \u226450MB per-file and total \u2264100MB.\nStep 5: Validate file integrity, preview in the platform viewer, follow naming/metadata conventions, and retry upload.",
      "answer": "Compress PPTX (image compression, remove media) to ~42MB and optimize XLSX (remove hidden data, summarize tables) to ~32MB; final total \u2248 74MB. Both files will then meet the 50MB per-file and 100MB total limits. Verify previews and metadata before submitting."

      "question": "How should an HR administrator configure Opportunity Marketplace so Excel attachments that contain potential personal data remain GDPR-compliant while still providing recruiters enough information to evaluate candidates?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify regulatory and platform controls required for GDPR compliance.\n- Define upload-time safeguards and preprocessing steps.\n- Specify access, retention, and audit settings for recruiter use.\n- Outline user guidance and consent controls to minimize risk.\n\nStep 1: Classify acceptable content and identify PII fields that should not be shared (e.g., national ID, full birthdate, personal contact details). Provide templates instructing applicants which fields to remove or anonymize.\nStep 2: Enforce upload-time checks: require applicants to confirm they removed PII, scan files for common PII patterns, and present warnings if matches are found. Offer an automatic redaction tool or guidance to mask sensitive cells before upload.\nStep 3: Configure storage and access: ensure encryption in transit and at rest, enable role-based access controls so only authorized recruiters can view attachments, and restrict downloads where legal risk exists (preview-only viewer with masked sensitive cells).\nStep 4: Set retention and auditing: apply minimal retention periods, keep detailed upload and access logs for audits, and support candidate requests for deletion/portability per GDPR.\nStep 5: Document legal basis and consent: collect explicit applicant consent where necessary, surface privacy notices during upload, and maintain records of consent and processing purposes.",
      "answer": "Configure templates and upload checks to strip or mask PII, provide redaction guidance/tools, enforce encryption and RBAC, enable preview-only access for recruiters, maintain short retention policies and detailed audit logs, and collect explicit consent to meet GDPR requirements."

      "reasoning": "- Specify a secure parsing and feature-extraction pipeline that avoids storing raw PII.\n- Define anonymization, derived-feature storage, and access controls.\n- Integrate consent, explainability, and logging into AI usage.\n- Ensure compliance by combining technical and policy safeguards.\n\nStep 1: Ingest attachments into a secure parsing sandbox (isolated environment) that extracts structural metadata (slide counts, keywords, charts) and derived quantitative features (skills mentioned, performance metrics summaries) instead of raw cell values or unredacted text.\nStep 2: Apply automatic PII detection and strip or token\u2011mask any detected personal identifiers before feature extraction. Store only anonymized or aggregated features (e.g., counts, normalized scores, topic vectors).\nStep 3: Encrypt raw files at rest with strict RBAC; keep them inaccessible to models unless explicit, logged, and consented access is granted. Feed only the derived feature vectors into matching models.\nStep 4: Maintain explainability and user controls: record which features influenced matches, allow applicants to opt out of content-based matching, and surface summaries to recruiters rather than raw files.\nStep 5: Log all processing, ensure retention policy for derived data, and periodically review models for bias and privacy compliance.",
      "answer": "Use a secure sandbox to extract anonymized, aggregated features (not raw PII) from attachments, store only derived vectors for matching, keep raw files encrypted with strict RBAC, obtain applicant consent and provide opt-out, and maintain audit logs and explainability for compliance."
