  "summary": "The document reports initial 2025 findings on AI-assisted writing and outlines a focused search plan targeting SAP SuccessFactors integrations, technical frameworks, HR use cases (recruiting, onboarding, compensation, talent development), data/training/privacy, adoption challenges, competitor comparisons, trends, and ROI. It then synthesizes a comprehensive report describing SAP implementations (NLG, ML models, SAP BTP), expected benefits (time savings, improved content quality, analytics-driven transparency), and key limitations (contextual errors, data dependency, and user trust/adoption barriers).",
