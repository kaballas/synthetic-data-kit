  "summary": "The document is a 10-step research plan to analyze stale onboarding to\u2011do tasks and home page cards in SAP\u2019s Onboarding ecosystem, covering definitions, causes, detection, Quick Fix tooling, removal processes, roles, data sources, optimization (including AI), KPIs, and a final best\u2011practice strategy. An initial search found SAP documentation mentioning a new Onboarding check tool with a Quick Fix to remove stale items but lacking explicit timing/flagging criteria; the next step is targeted technical research into detection algorithms, system behavior, and industry best practices.",

      "question": "How can you define a practical rule to classify an SAP Onboarding to-do task or home page card as \"stale\" when SAP documentation does not specify timing, and how would you validate that rule on historical system logs?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take to generate this example:\n  - Identify observable signals available in SAP Onboarding logs.\n  - Propose a compact, implementable stale-rule using those signals.\n  - Design a validation plan using historical logs and experiments.\n\nStep 1: Identify candidate signals (non-sensitive summary): last user action timestamp, task status (e.g., Pending), assignee activity state, related event stream (emails, approvals), and account lifecycle flags (terminated/inactive).\n\nStep 2: Propose a conservative rule (operational summary): mark item stale if (a) no user or system interaction recorded for N days, AND (b) task status remains Pending/Not Started, AND (c) no linked events in the same period; alternatively automatically stale if assigned user is inactive/terminated.\n\nStep 3: Recommend a starting N value and safety overrides: choose N = 90 days as a conservative default; exclude tasks with explicit future-due dates or recurring items; require manager or system confirmation before permanent deletion.\n\nStep 4: Validation plan (high-level): run retrospective classification on historical logs, compute precision/recall of the rule against labeled examples (manually reviewed subset), measure reactivation rate (items classified stale but later acted upon), and simulate user impact via an A/B rollout of Quick Fix with rollback monitoring.\n\nStep 5: Acceptance criteria (summary): precision \u2265 90% on manual labels, reactivation rate \u2264 5% over 60 days, no statistically significant increase in reported user issues in A/B experiment.\n\nStep 6: Iteration: tune N and exclusions based on false-positive drivers found in validation (e.g., seasonal workflows, long-delayed approvals).",
      "answer": "Use a conservative rule: stale if no interaction for 90 days AND status is Pending AND no linked events in 90 days, or if assignee is inactive. Validate by retrospective log labeling (precision/recall), measure reactivation rate (\u22645%), and run an A/B Quick Fix rollout before full deployment."
