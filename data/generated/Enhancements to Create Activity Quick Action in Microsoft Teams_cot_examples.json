  "summary": "The document analyzes the \"Create Activity\" quick action in Microsoft Teams as part of the SAP SuccessFactors Continuous Performance Management integration, explaining that it lets users create and link performance/development activities in Teams while syncing with SuccessFactors via secure API/SSO-based connections. It summarizes recent updates, architecture, data flow and security, user scenarios and productivity benefits, implementation challenges, admin/developer extension points, and strategic recommendations for effective adoption.",

      "question": "How should an organization reliably map Activities created in Microsoft Teams to the correct SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals records when users hold multiple roles (employee, manager, reviewer), ensuring correct ownership, visibility, and auditability?",
      "reasoning": "- Verify identity and role mapping via SSO tokens and HR profile linkage.\n- Determine role-priority rules and fallback behaviors for ambiguous cases.\n- Enforce permission checks and explicit user confirmation when needed.\n\nSummary of approach:\nStep 1: Confirm the user identity from Azure AD token and resolve the linked SuccessFactors user ID (employeeNumber or userId) via the established mapping service.\nStep 2: Query the SuccessFactors permissions and role assignments for that user (employee, manager, reviewer) at the target goal scope before creating the activity.\nStep 3: Apply a deterministic role-priority rule (e.g., manager > reviewer > employee) to select the default role used for linking; if multiple roles are equally valid for the target goal, require explicit role selection in the Teams UI.\nStep 4: Validate that the selected role has create/link permission for the specific goal record; if not, surface an error and suggest the permitted role(s).\nStep 5: Create the activity via the SuccessFactors API with the resolved goal ID and role context; record the creator, effective role, timestamps, and correlation IDs for audit logs.\nStep 6: Set visibility according to SuccessFactors permission model (restrict to role participants) and mirror that visibility metadata into Teams UI cards for consistency.\nStep 7: Emit an audit entry (who, where, role used, goalId, activityId) to both SuccessFactors audit logs and the tenant monitoring channel for compliance.\n\nThis approach avoids ambiguity, ensures explicit consent when needed, enforces permissions, and leaves a clear audit trail.",
      "answer": "Resolve identity via SSO, determine role using a deterministic priority (manager > reviewer > employee) or require user selection if ambiguous, validate permissions, create the activity with the resolved goalId and role context, and write audit metadata (creator, role, timestamps) to both SuccessFactors and tenant logs."
