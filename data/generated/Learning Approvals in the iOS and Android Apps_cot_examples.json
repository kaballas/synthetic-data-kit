The mobile workflow mirrors the web lifecycle and backend integration but can lack some web features (e.g., bulk processing), and users report occasional notification delays and UI navigation differences across platforms.",

If handling each request on the mobile app takes 6 minutes on average and handling the same requests via the web (with bulk actions) takes 2 minutes on average per request, how much total time is spent in each case, what is the absolute time difference, and what is the percentage difference in time between mobile and web?",
