  "summary": "The Configure Assignments feature in SAP Opportunity Marketplace lets administrators create, edit, and localize assignment types (name, status, max duration, default image, and descriptive help text) that are transportable via unique IDs and appear during assignment creation and application. These descriptions and metadata integrate with SuccessFactors modules (LMS, recruiting, capability portfolios) to improve searchability, recommendations, UX, and workforce planning; administrators should keep descriptions clear, consistent, translated, and regularly reviewed to maximize engagement and alignment with talent development goals.",

      "question": "If a development instance has 5 assignment types (A\u2013E) where A and B are active and C, D, E are inactive, and the admin transports all types to production which currently has no assignment types, will end users be able to create assignments immediately after transport? If not, what must be done pre-transport to ensure creation is possible?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I'll follow:\n  - Identify active/inactive statuses and business rule requirements.\n  - Determine what status values are transported.\n  - Evaluate post-transport state against the \"at least one active\" creation constraint.\n  - State the minimal pre-transport action required.\nStep 1: Note the business rule: at least one assignment type must be active for users to create assignments.\nStep 2: Transport moves configuration metadata (including active/inactive flags and unique IDs) from Dev to Prod.\nStep 3: After transport, production will have the same active statuses as the source (A and B active; C, D, E inactive).\nStep 4: Because A and B are active in the transported set, production will have at least one active type and users can create assignments immediately.\nStep 5: If instead all transported types had been inactive, the required pre-transport action would be to activate at least one type in the source before transporting (or activate one in production post-transport using an admin role).\n",
      "answer": "Yes \u2014 because A and B are active, production will have at least one active type after transport and users can create assignments. If no types were active, the admin must activate at least one type before (or immediately after) transport."
