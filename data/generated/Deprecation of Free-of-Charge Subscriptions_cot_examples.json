  "summary": "The document outlines a systematic research plan to collect SAP official documentation, release notes, migration guides, and customer use cases to produce a detailed report on the free-of-charge subscription deprecation in SAP Learning. Preliminary findings note an End of Maintenance on May 17, 2024 and final deletion on November 15, 2025, and further targeted review of SAP roadmaps, migration materials, and customer impacts is required to answer the ten detailed questions.",

Also, how many days are there between End of Maintenance and deletion?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - Identify official milestone dates from the input.\n  - Compute the number of days between the two dates.\n  - Add migration duration and validation buffer to determine required lead time.\n  - Subtract lead time from deletion date to find latest start date.\n  - Confirm the derived start date relative to End of Maintenance.\n\nStep 1: Identify dates from the text: End of Maintenance = 2024-05-17; Deletion = 2025-11-15.\nStep 2: Compute days between 2024-05-17 and 2025-11-15: one full year (365 days) plus the days from 2025-05-17 to 2025-11-15 (182 days) => 365 + 182 = 547 days.\nStep 3: Required lead time = migration (6 months) + validation buffer (3 months) = 9 months. Nine months before 2025-11-15 is 2025-02-15.\nStep 4: Verify relation to End of Maintenance: 2025-02-15 is after 2024-05-17, so starting by 2025-02-15 fits within the maintenance-to-deletion window.\nStep 5: Conclude latest practical start date and the interval between milestones without revealing internal deliberation details.",

      "question": "A company has 500 learners; 20% currently use the free-of-charge subscription that will be removed. If after removal 60% of those affected users will migrate to a \"basic\" paid tier at $60/user/year and 40% to a \"professional\" tier at $100/user/year, what is the annual incremental licensing cost and the incremental cost per total learner?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Determine number of affected users: 500 learners * 20% = 100 users.\nStep 2: Allocate affected users by tier: 60% to basic => 100 * 0.60 = 60 users; 40% to professional => 100 * 0.40 = 40 users.\nStep 3: Compute annual cost per tier: basic = 60 users * $60 = $3,600; professional = 40 users * $100 = $4,000.\nStep 4: Sum incremental annual cost = $3,600 + $4,000 = $7,600.\nStep 5: Compute incremental cost per total learner = $7,600 / 500 learners = $15.20 per learner per year.\nStep 6: Present concise results derived from the above arithmetic without exposing private chain-of-thought.",

      "question": "If an organization wants to map permissions that relied on the free-of-charge subscription (which functioned as a pricing override tied to roles and catalog access) to the new tiered subscription model before deletion on November 15, 2025, what sequence of technical steps should they follow to minimize access disruption?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Inventory current users and catalog access rules that depend on the free subscription override.\nStep 2: Map each user/role to the equivalent tiered subscription offering (customer, partner, professional) based on content needs and certification requirements.\nStep 3: Update entitlement definitions in the learning platform: create new subscription assignments or role-to-tier mappings, preserving least-privilege access.\nStep 4: Configure pricing/entitlement enforcement so that catalog access no longer relies on the deprecated override mechanism.\nStep 5: Run a staged pilot (subset of users) to validate access, reporting, and certification attempt limits; capture issues.\nStep 6: Roll out changes in phases, monitor logs and user reports, and keep a rollback plan for discovered regressions.\nStep 7: Complete final verification at least the planned validation buffer before deletion date.\nThese steps are an operational summary to ensure a safe migration from role-based pricing overrides to explicit tier assignments.",
      "answer": "Follow: (1) inventory overrides and users; (2) map users/roles to new tiers; (3) update entitlements and pricing enforcement; (4) pilot and validate; (5) phased rollout with monitoring and rollback plan; (6) final verification before deletion."
