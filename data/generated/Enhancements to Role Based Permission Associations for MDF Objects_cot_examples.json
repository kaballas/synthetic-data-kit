      "question": "Given a Generic Object field 'Department' with Value Help referencing the Department MDF, a Valid When association that restricts departments to the user's Country field, and two RBP Permission Roles assigned to a user: Role A grants view access only to departments in Country = 'US' and create rights; Role B grants view access to all departments but no create rights. With \"Enable RBP Target Criteria for Value Help\" enabled, which department records will appear in the Value Help dropdown for this user when their Country is set to 'US'?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will use:\n  - Identify inputs (Valid When, RBP roles, user attributes, setting enabled)\n  - Determine aggregated visibility from multiple roles (permission union model)\n  - Apply Valid When association filtering on top of RBP-filtered target set\n  - Produce the final visible set for Value Help\n\nStep 1: Identify inputs: Valid When limits departments to the user's Country; user Country = 'US'. RBP: Role A allows view for Country='US' only; Role B allows view for all countries. Setting is enabled so Value Help enforces RBP target criteria.\nStep 2: Aggregate role permissions: SuccessFactors RBP aggregates permissions across assigned roles (permissions are unioned). Therefore the user's effective view permission is the union of Role A and Role B \u2014 which is view access to all departments (because Role B permits all).\nStep 3: Apply Valid When constraint: Valid When further restricts what the Value Help presents to only departments where Department.Country = user's Country = 'US'. Valid When is applied in the lookup flow after RBP filtering, so the intersection of (RBP-visible records) and (Valid When-matching records) is returned.\nStep 4: Compute final set: RBP-visible = all departments; Valid When-matching = departments with Country='US'; intersection = all departments whose Country='US'. Thus the dropdown will show department records for Country = 'US' only. Create rights are separate and do not change which existing departments are listed in Value Help.\n",

This reduces the amount of data sent to the client (good for UI responsiveness) but can increase backend query complexity and processing per request (potentially increasing server load). For a per-user result of ~500 items, the perceived UI performance generally improves because the client receives far fewer records to render; backend impact is manageable if queries are well-indexed and caching is used.\nStep 4: Recommended optimizations: (1) Add/ensure database indexes on the association keys and country field so permission + Valid When queries are fast; (2) Enable typeahead / incremental search or server-side paging for Value Help so the UI requests smaller subsets (e.g., top 50) instead of all 500 at once; (3) Cache common RBP-filtered lookup results for role-country combinations or use short-lived server-side caches to reduce repeated permission-evaluation costs.\n",
