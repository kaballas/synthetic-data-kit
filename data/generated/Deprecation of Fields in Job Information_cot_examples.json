  "summary": "The document summarizes an investigation of SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central \"change-reason\" and \"change-reason-external\" fields, explaining they are Event Reason foundation objects used to record why HR events occur and are critical for lifecycle status, reporting, and integrations. It states SAP plans to deprecate and remove these fields on November 14, 2025, and recommends organizations inventory usage, archive/migrate historical data, adopt alternative event-reason or custom-field solutions, and coordinate HR\u2013IT efforts to avoid compliance, reporting, and integration disruptions.",
