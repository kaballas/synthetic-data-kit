  "summary": "The document outlines a structured research plan to gather authoritative SAP and enterprise-level sources on time-sheet workflows, common submission errors, detection/blocking methods, and optimization strategies. The synthesized findings summarize typical workflows, error types and payroll/compliance impacts, SAP validation and blocking mechanisms (rule-based checks, cross-module validation, notifications), and configurable best practices to enforce quality while preserving user experience. The final report will propose an integrated strategy with KPIs, measurement tools, and recommendations for training, UI feedback, and automation to reduce error-prone submissions.",
