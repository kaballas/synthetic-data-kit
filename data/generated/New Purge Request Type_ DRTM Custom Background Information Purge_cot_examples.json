  "summary": "The document describes the DRTM Custom Background Information Purge in SAP SuccessFactors as a targeted data-retention feature that selectively removes specific custom background elements from employee records (including active users), distinct from broader profile purges and requiring careful handling of custom data models and dependencies. It outlines the end-to-end workflow (request, approval, targeting, execution, audit, validation), regulatory and security requirements (GDPR/CCPA, logging, role-based controls), major risks (data integrity, reporting impact, operational disruption) and recommends thorough planning, validation, and SAP best practices to mitigate those risks.",
