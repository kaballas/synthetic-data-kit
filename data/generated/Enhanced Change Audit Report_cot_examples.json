  "summary": "The document analyzes SAP Identity Provisioning Change Audit reports with emphasis on user-identification columns and the recent shift to explicitly labeled fields (\"Provisioning User ID\" / \"Provisioning User Email\"), arguing this improves traceability, audit clarity, and alignment with GDPR/SOX and SAP governance. It summarizes benefits (better auditability, security, and operational efficiency), risks (label-change impacts on integrations and user confusion), and next steps to perform targeted searches for detailed report structures, standards, and compliance evidence.",
