  "summary": "The document describes NominationService.svc as an OData V4 RESTful service in SAP SuccessFactors for managing succession and nomination records, supporting CRUD (including an upsertNomination operation), rich querying (filter/expand), batch/atomic transactions, and delta synchronization. It also details security and integration aspects (HTTPS, OAuth2, CSRF protection), the nomination entity schema (userId, nominationTarget, readiness, rank, note, emergencyCover boolean), extensibility/ navigation to related modules, and use of OData action attributes and standard error semantics.",
