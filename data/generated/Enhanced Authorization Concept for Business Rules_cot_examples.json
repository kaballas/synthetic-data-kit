It details recent authorization enhancements\u2014more granular permission scopes, API and UI enforcement, and recommended RBP configuration, testing, and governance practices to secure rule lifecycle operations.",

      "answer": "Assign scopes as follows \u2014 Rule Creator: create, edit, view; Rule Approver: activate, deactivate, view; Rule Admin: create, edit, activate, deactivate, delete, view. Place creators and approvers in separate permission groups, test in sandbox, and enable audit logging."

      "answer": "Configure per-org-unit permission groups and minimal-role scopes, validate in sandbox, require approvals/audit logging for activations, phase rollout (pilot \u2192 phased \u2192 production), and expand permissions only after successful validation and sign-off."
