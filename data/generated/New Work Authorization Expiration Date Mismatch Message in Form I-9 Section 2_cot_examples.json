  "summary": "Form I-9 verifies identity and employment authorization for U.S. hires, with the employee completing Section 1 (personal info, attestation, and work-authorization expiration date if applicable) and the employer or authorized representative completing Section 2 (examining original documents, recording document details and expiration dates) within required timeframes. The work-authorization expiration date is recorded in both sections when applicable and is critical for future reverification; employers must ensure the dates match (often by visual check or automated validation) to avoid compliance risks. Common mismatches arise from human error, employee misunderstandings, document renewals, multiple documents with differing dates, timing issues, or system limitations.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Note rule \u2014 Section 2 must be completed within three business days of the employee's first day; if employment lasts less than three days, complete by first day.\nStep 2: Count business days starting the next business day after hire: hire is Friday, so business days are Mon (July 5), Tue (July 6), Wed (July 7); three business days end on Wednesday, July 7.\nStep 3: Weekends are not business days and do not reduce the three-business-day window.\nStep 4: If Section 2 is not completed by July 7, employer should promptly complete Section 2, document reason for delay, and correct the I-9 per USCIS guidance; expect potential audit scrutiny and remedial steps to minimize compliance risk.",
      "answer": "Section 2 must be completed by Wednesday, July 7. Weekends do not count as business days. If missed, complete it immediately, document the delay and corrections, and follow USCIS corrective procedures to mitigate compliance risk."

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Apply rule \u2014 employer must record document details exactly as on the physical document in Section 2; employer entries in Section 2 are authoritative for document data.\nStep 2: Therefore, record the document expiration date as 11/30/2025 in Section 2 regardless of the Section 1 entry.\nStep 3: For Section 1, employer should ask the employee to correct the attestation if possible, or note the discrepancy per internal correction procedure; the employer should not rely on the incorrect Section 1 date for compliance actions.\nStep 4: Reverification (Section 3) must be scheduled before 11/30/2025 so the employee does not continue working beyond authorization; set reminders sufficiently in advance to allow timely action.",
