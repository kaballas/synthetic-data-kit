  "summary": "The document is a research log summarizing an investigation of the Pixel Perfect Talent Card (PPTC) in SAP SuccessFactors\u2014its BIRT/XML-based architecture, customizable one-page talent profiles, and primary use cases in succession planning and talent reviews\u2014along with searches for SAP communications about a planned End of Maintenance (EOM) and deletion on November 15, 2025. The researcher found that SAP initially planned EOM due to aging technology and a push to newer analytics platforms, but withdrew the deprecation after strong customer feedback about PPTC\u2019s unique value and migration challenges; the report will analyze communications, alternatives, impacts, and recommendations.",

      "question": "Given an organization with 1,500 employees and ~200 existing Pixel Perfect Talent Card (PPTC) BIRT templates, what is a realistic phased migration timeline and staffing estimate to move equivalent capabilities to SAP Report Story and BTP-based custom reports while minimizing disruption?",
      "reasoning": "- Inventory current state: list templates, complexity, data sources, and custom code.\n- Classify templates by complexity (low/medium/high) and prioritize.\n- Pilot conversion on a representative subset to measure per-template effort.\n- Scale conversion using measured productivity rates, allocating parallel teams.\n- Schedule parallel validation, stakeholder sign-off, and phased cutover with buffer.\n\nStep 1: Inventory and classification \u2014 create a catalogue of 200 templates and tag each as low, medium, or high complexity based on number of data joins, custom scripts, and PDF layout requirements.\nStep 2: Pilot measurement \u2014 convert a small sample (e.g., 2 low, 2 medium, 1 high) to Report Story/BTP to measure hours per template for mapping data, recreating visuals, and validating output.\nStep 3: Derive productivity rates \u2014 from the pilot, compute average hours: assume 20h for low, 60h for medium, 160h for high templates (adjust after pilot).\nStep 4: Resource planning \u2014 estimate FTE months by summing effort and dividing by available productive hours per resource (e.g., 140 hours/month per developer/tester with overlapping QA).\nStep 5: Phased rollout \u2014 prioritize high-impact templates first, run parallel validation with business users, and keep PPTC available until final sign-off.\nStep 6: Buffer and training \u2014 add contingency (20\u201330%) and allocate training/knowledge transfer for BIRT and new platform operations.",
      "answer": "Assuming template distribution of 50% low (100), 35% medium (70), 15% high (30) and pilot-derived averages of 20h/low, 60h/medium, 160h/high: total effort \u2248 (100*20)+(70*60)+(30*160)=2,000+4,200+4,800=11,000 hours. At 140 productive hours/month per resource, that is \u224879 resource-months. With a 6-month program footprint, plan ~13 full-time equivalents (FTEs) (79/6) plus 25% contingency \u2192 ~16 FTEs over 6 months. Phased rollout with pilot and validation reduces disruption; retain PPTC until migrated templates are validated."

      "question": "For critical succession-planning workflows relying on pixel-perfect PDFs and deep Employee Profile integration, which solution strategy best preserves functionality: keep PPTC, migrate to Report Story, or build custom BTP reports? Provide a defensible recommendation.",
      "reasoning": "- Identify must-have capabilities: pixel-perfect PDF output, tight employee-profile launch, role-based visibility, and existing BIRT template complexity.\n- Map each platform's strengths and gaps against these requirements.\n- Assess migration risk, time, and operational overhead for each option.\n- Recommend a pragmatic strategy that balances continuity and future-readiness.\n\nStep 1: Capture firm requirements \u2014 pixel-perfect export, in-profile quick actions, custom layout control, and existing BIRT-coded logic are high priority.\nStep 2: Feature mapping \u2014 PPTC (native pixel control and in-profile access) meets requirements today; Report Story offers modern visuals but limited 1:1 pixel-control and different embedding; BTP custom reports can match pixel output but require development to re-create profile integration and access controls.\nStep 3: Risk and cost assessment \u2014 full migration to Report Story risks functional gaps and rework; BTP custom rebuild is capable but high-cost and requires integration work; retaining PPTC minimizes near-term risk but defers long-term platform alignment.\nStep 4: Recommendation formulation \u2014 weigh customer dependency, migration complexity, and strategic alignment with SAP\u2019s cloud direction.",
      "answer": "Recommended hybrid strategy: retain PPTC for mission-critical, pixel-perfect succession workflows to preserve continuity, while initiating parallel pilots on Report Story and BTP for future-proofing. Rebuild lower-complexity cards in Report Story and plan phased BTP development for templates requiring custom logic or advanced integration. This balances risk, maintains functionality, and creates a migration path."

      "answer": "90-day mitigation: (1) freeze and catalogue critical templates; (2) export and back up all BIRT assets; (3) use scheduled PDF exports or batch generation as interim delivery; (4) run rapid pilots to convert highest-priority templates; (5) engage SAP/partners and train staff; (6) implement phased cutovers aligned to HR cycles. This preserves operations and buys time for migration."
