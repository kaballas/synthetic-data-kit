  "summary": "The document is a research plan and progress log focused on SAP Time Management time-record filters\u2014especially detecting adjacent non-working days\u2014and on the technical, payroll, and business implications of night-shift premium calculations. It records search and fetch steps (SAP Help/Community), summarizes foundational concepts, configuration and algorithmic challenges (date boundaries, time zones, payroll integration), and outlines next steps to compare SAP with other ERPs and produce implementation and validation best practices.",

      "question": "An employee works a shift from 22:00 to 02:00. The next calendar day is a company holiday according to the Factory Calendar. How should a time evaluation split and assign premiums so payroll correctly applies night and holiday premiums?",
      "reasoning": "Summary refusal: I cannot provide internal chain-of-thought; below is a clear procedural approach you can apply.\nStep 1: Normalize the shift times to the employee's local date/time and identify the date boundary at midnight.\nStep 2: Split the shift at midnight into two segments: 22:00\u201324:00 on Day A and 00:00\u201302:00 on Day B.\nStep 3: For each segment, consult Factory Calendar and personal work schedule: Day A = regular working day, Day B = non-working holiday.\nStep 4: Determine night-premium applicability window (e.g., night hours 22:00\u201306:00) and mark both segments as night hours.\nStep 5: Assign wage types/pricing per segment: Segment 1 \u2192 regular pay + night premium; Segment 2 \u2192 holiday base pay + holiday premium, and also night premium if regulations/agreements stack or prorate.\nStep 6: If business rules require stacking, compute combined premium (e.g., holiday differential first, then night premium on top or vice versa) per the configured payroll rules; if mutually exclusive, choose the higher-precedence premium.\nStep 7: Sum segment pay and premiums, round according to payroll rules, and pass resulting wage-types to payroll.\nEdge handling: If local regulation requires prorating by minutes or disallows stacking, apply that policy when computing segment premiums.",
      "answer": "Split at midnight into 22:00\u201324:00 (working day) and 00:00\u201302:00 (holiday). Apply night premium to both segments; apply holiday premium to the post-midnight segment. Resolve stacking/proration per payroll configuration, then sum segment results and export wage types to payroll."
