Additionally, if HR task completion speed improves by up to 90% for related administrative tasks, how would that affect a weekly 8-hour HR administrative workload tied to onboarding?",
      "reasoning": "I can\u2019t provide internal chain-of-thought, but here is a concise, high-level summary of the steps used to compute results:\n- Step 1: Apply the reported maximum onboarding reduction (50%) to the baseline onboarding duration: $12\\,\\text{days} \\times (1 - 0.50)$.\n- Step 2: Compute the new onboarding duration.\n- Step 3: For HR administrative workload, apply the reported up-to-90% faster completion claim to the weekly 8-hour workload: an improvement of 90% means work takes 10% of original time.\n- Step 4: Compute the new weekly HR administrative hours and present both results.",
