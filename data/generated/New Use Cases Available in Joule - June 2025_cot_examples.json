  "summary": "Joule\u2019s June 2025 update centralizes identity on SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS) with multi-tenant OpenID Connect (OIDC) trust and mandates the SAP Global User ID (UUID) for consistent cross-system identity (phasing out SAML), improving security and cross-service mapping but requiring careful trust and tenant configuration.  \nSimultaneously, Joule Studio is generally available for low-code/no-code creation of AI agents and expanded real-time NLP capabilities (including new SuccessFactors transactional and navigational scenarios), enabling faster AI-driven automation and insights while exposing migration and identity-fragmentation challenges.",

Recommended 10-week timeline:\n- Weeks 1\u20132: Inventory IdPs, IAS tenants, and identify proxy-only users; prepare config templates.\n- Weeks 3\u20134: Configure OIDC trust and trusted domains per tenant; set up test tenants.\n- Week 5: End-to-end testing and integration validation with Joule, Task Center, AMS.\n- Week 6: Pilot with a limited user group; enable parallel SAML support.\n- Weeks 7\u20138: Gradual rollout across remaining tenants/users; resolve issues; persist users in IdDS as needed.\n- Week 9: Start deprecating SAML for services that passed validation.\n- Week 10: Full monitoring, final cutover of remaining services, and post-migration reconciliation.\nMitigations: maintain parallel SAML during pilot, have rollback configs, and monitor UUID issuance and cross-service flows continuously."
