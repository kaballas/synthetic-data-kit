It recommends a DQM microservices approach\u2014real-time/batch REST APIs, reference/enrichment data, fuzzy matching and geocoding, event-driven workflows, and governance/security/performance controls\u2014with monitoring and continuous-improvement processes for scalable global deployment.",

      "question": "How would you detect and correct inconsistencies where postal codes do not match stated regions across a global Employee Central dataset, and how would you compute the proportion of affected records?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify authoritative reference mappings and normalization rules\n- Run deterministic checks, then apply fuzzy matching for ambiguous cases\n- Flag mismatches, propose automated corrections where high-confidence, and route low-confidence cases for review\n\nStep 1: Normalize address fields (country \u2192 ISO 3166 code, trim/normalize region and postal code formats) so comparisons use canonical forms.\nStep 2: Use a reference database mapping postal codes to regions (per country). For each record, look up the postal code and obtain the canonical region(s).\nStep 3: Deterministic check: if canonical region matches the record's region, mark valid. If not, mark mismatch.\nStep 4: For mismatches, run confidence heuristics: exact street/locality matches, geocode proximity, and postal-format validity. If confidence \u2265 threshold (e.g., 90%), propose an automated correction (update region to canonical). If below threshold, flag for manual review and attach suggested alternatives.\nStep 5: Compute metrics: affected_records = number of records flagged as mismatch. Proportion (%) = (affected_records / total_records) * 100. Track submetrics: false-positive rate (via sampling), correction acceptance rate, and time-to-resolution for manual cases.\nStep 6: Feed corrections and reviewed outcomes back into training datasets and update exception rules and reference data ingestion cadence to reduce recurrence.",

      "reasoning": "- Define separate real-time and batch pathways sharing core validation services\n- Use caching, API gateway, and scalable microservices to meet latency and throughput targets\n- Implement security, auditing, and exception management with feedback loops\n\nStep 1: Core services: deploy an Address Validation microservice cluster (stateless) exposing REST APIs; a Reference Data Store (authoritative postal mappings, geodata) kept current via automated ingestion; and a Geocoding/Enrichment service for spatial checks.\nStep 2: Real-time flow: UI \u2192 API Gateway \u2192 Auth & Rate-limiting \u2192 Cache (recent lookups) \u2192 Address Validation service \u2192 (if needed) Geocoding service \u2192 return normalized address + suggestions.

High-confidence corrections auto-apply (with audit trail); uncertain cases create tickets/workflows for human review.
