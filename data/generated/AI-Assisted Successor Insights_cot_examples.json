  "summary": "**Summary**\n\nSAP Business AI\u2019s succession-planning capabilities combine predictive ML, LLM-based generative models, and integrated skills taxonomies to produce successor recommendations, readiness forecasts, and scenario simulations using structured and unstructured HR data; the report details metrics, privacy/ethical controls, deployment limitations, market positioning, and case-study evidence on decision-quality improvements. Effective use requires blending AI insights with human judgment, robust bias mitigation, explainability, and strong data governance to realize optimized and equitable succession outcomes.",
