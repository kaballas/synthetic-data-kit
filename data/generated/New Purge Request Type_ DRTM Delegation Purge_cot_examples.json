  "summary": "The document explains SAP Data Retention Management (DRTM) and the new \"DRTM Delegation Purge\" request type, detailing its architecture, execution flow, triggers, and how it identifies and purges delegation request records (delegator, delegatee, and review subject) based on configured retention times. It also covers prerequisites and configuration (permissions, retention setup, file formats, approval workflows), common errors and verification metrics, and emphasizes compliance, auditability, security, and performance benefits (e.g., GDPR alignment).",
