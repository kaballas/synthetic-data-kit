  "summary": "The document explains that SAP SuccessFactors\u2019 Temporary Holiday Calendar and Temporary Work Schedule quick approval cards let employees and managers create, review, and approve short\u2011term changes to holiday calendars or work schedules without altering permanent job records, storing those changes in the Temporary Time Information object (now with a Category field) and enforcing collision rules and workflow approvals. Recent enhancements improve UI and deep\u2011linking, add search/amend/delete options, strengthen workflow and validation, and ensure near\u2011real\u2011time replication to payroll and other systems via OData/CPI integrations to maintain compliance and auditability.",

      "question": "An employee travels from Country A to Country B for 10 days; Country B has a public holiday that falls within the travel window. What exact Temporary Time Information (TTI) configuration, approval timing, and payroll replication steps are needed to ensure the employee is paid correctly for the holiday without altering permanent job information?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take to generate this example:\n  - Identify the TTI object fields and needed values.\n  - Determine approval and timing constraints relative to payroll cutoffs.\n  - Specify replication and validation steps for payroll integration.\n  - Note testing and audit steps to confirm correct pay.\n\nStep 1: Configure the TTI entry\n- Create a Temporary Time Information record with Category = \"Holiday Calendar\".\n- Set Start Date and End Date to cover the full travel period (10 days) so the temporary calendar applies for the holiday date.\n- Reference the Country B holiday calendar in the calendar field.\n\nStep 2: Approval workflow and timing\n- Ensure an approval workflow is triggered on submission; assign approvers and require approval before payroll cutoff.\n- If payroll cutoff precedes approval, implement an emergency manual replication or delay payroll run until TTI is approved.\n\nStep 3: Collision and validation\n- Validate that no conflicting TTI exists for the same period; if collision rules block this, enable appropriate Time Management Collision Resolution settings or resolve the conflict before approval.\n\nStep 4: Replication to payroll and time tracking\n- Configure replication (OData/Integration Center/CPI) to send approved TTI to payroll and time tracking systems; ensure replication completes before payroll calculation.\n- Map the temporary holiday calendar so payroll recognizes the holiday for pay rules (holiday pay, overtime rules, shift differentials).\n\nStep 5: Testing and audit\n- Perform pre-production tests with representative employee records and payroll runs verifying that the holiday date is treated per Country B rules.\n- Keep approval workflow and audit logs as evidence for compliance.\n\nConcise validation: these steps ensure the temporary holiday calendar applies only during travel, is approved in time, and is replicated so payroll applies Country B holiday pay rules.",
      "answer": "Create a TTI record with Category=\"Holiday Calendar\" covering the 10-day travel, point it to Country B calendar, ensure approval completes before payroll cutoff (or delay payroll), resolve any collisions, replicate approved TTI to payroll via Integration Center/CPI, and validate via test payroll runs and audit logs."
