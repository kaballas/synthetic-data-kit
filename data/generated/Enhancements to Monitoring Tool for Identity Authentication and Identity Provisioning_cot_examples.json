  "summary": "Monitoring tools for SAP IAS/IPS provide real-time job and authentication monitoring, error logging, transformation/mapping visibility, and dashboarded status for administrators, security officers, implementers, and support staff within the SAP Cloud Identity Services ecosystem. Migrations proceed through staged assessment, testing, pilot, cutover and post\u2011migration monitoring, with common failures around attribute mapping, authentication/authorization, and limited diagnostic visibility; recommended fixes include multi\u2011level drilldowns, clearer error messages, role\u2011specific notifications, guided troubleshooting, and incident\u2011management integration.",
