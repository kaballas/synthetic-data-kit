For SAP specifically, findings highlight integration complexity, scalability/customization limits, UX consistency and latency issues, and iterative trade\u2011offs between configurability and out\u2011of\u2011the\u2011box usability, while improved dashboards are linked to better retention, satisfaction, and faster time\u2011to\u2011productivity. Next steps proposed are deeper technical research and empirical studies on role\u2011specific workflows, integration challenges, and implementation recommendations.",
