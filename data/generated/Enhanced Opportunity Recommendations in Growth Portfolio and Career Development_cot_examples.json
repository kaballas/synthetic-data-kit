  "summary": "The research is gathering detailed information on SAP SuccessFactors\u2019 Growth Portfolio and Career Worksheet\u2014focusing on how Opportunities to Grow are identified, presented, and specifically how non\u2011intelligent (rules\u2011based) recommendation mechanisms are generated and integrated. Using SAP documentation, whitepapers, and expert analyses, the next step is to synthesize these sources into an evidence\u2011backed, structured report comparing non\u2011AI vs AI recommendation models, their technical inputs, business rules, UX implications, risks, and optimization strategies.",

      "question": "How would you configure a rule-based (non-intelligent) recommendation pipeline to surface the top 5 \u2018Opportunities to Grow\u2019 for a mid-level employee targeting a senior role, given the Growth Portfolio and Career Worksheet context?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify relevant inputs and constraints from the text (skills, role profiles, tenure, policies).\n- Define rule mappings and thresholds to compute matches and gaps.\n- Design ranking and filtering logic and explainability labels.\n- Specify integration points, refresh cadence, and monitoring KPIs.\n\nI can\u2019t provide internal chain-of-thought transcripts, but here is a concise, non-sensitive summary of the logical approach:\nStep 1: List inputs \u2014 employee skills & proficiencies, target senior role required skills, available opportunities (courses, mentoring, openings), tenure and org priorities.\nStep 2: Compute skill gap per skill = required level \u2212 employee level; mark mandatory/optional skills.\nStep 3: Apply rules \u2014 exclude opportunities failing mandatory qualifications; give points per matched optional skills; add tenure or succession eligibility bonuses.\nStep 4: Aggregate into a relevance score (weighted sum of gap closeness, number of matched skills, organizational priority, opportunity availability).\nStep 5: Rank opportunities by score, take top 5, attach explainable labels (e.g., \u201cMatches 4/6 required skills; closes gap in X\u201d), and surface them in Growth Portfolio with a scheduled refresh and admin-configurable thresholds.\nStep 6: Monitor uptake and adjust rule weights periodically.\n",
      "answer": "Configure a rule engine that: computes skill gaps, applies mandatory filters, scores opportunities by weighted match and org priority, ranks results, and returns the top 5 with explainable labels; monitor uptake and adjust weights on a scheduled cadence."
