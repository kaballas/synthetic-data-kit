Subtracting 12 months gives 2025-11-20; subtracting 2 more months gives 2025-09-20.\nStep 4: Report the latest practical start date as 2025-09-20. Note governance: End of Maintenance was 2023-11-17, meaning there was no maintenance support after that date and the organization is recommended to begin migration earlier than the calculated latest start date to avoid unsupported-risk exposure.\n",
      "answer": "Latest recommended start date: 2025-09-20. Governance note: End of Maintenance on 2023-11-17 implies organizations should aim to start sooner than that latest-start calculation to avoid operating unsupported during migration."

Rationale: prevents missed dependencies that cause payroll failures.\nStep 2: Data Cleansing & Standardization \u2014 normalize picklist entries before migration to avoid inconsistent MDF records. Rationale: reduces migration errors and downstream mapping ambiguity.\nStep 3: Provision MDF Objects & Migrate Values \u2014 create Pay Scale Type/Area MDFs and run SAP migration jobs to transfer values. Rationale: establishes the new single source of truth before changing integrations.\nStep 4: Update Integration Mappings & Middleware \u2014 change API payloads, mapping rules, and middleware transforms to reference MDF IDs/fields. Rationale: ensures external systems receive expected values post-migration.\nStep 5: Update Business Rules, Workflows & Reports \u2014 modify rules and reports to use MDF objects and re-run test scenarios. Rationale: business logic and reporting must align with the new data model.\nStep 6: Payroll-Specific Mapping & End-to-End Testing \u2014 perform payroll interface tests including pay calculation, compensations, and country-specific validations. Rationale: directly verifies payroll correctness before cutover.\nStep 7: Compliance Validation & UAT \u2014 legal/regulatory checks and user acceptance testing in sandbox/test environments. Rationale: ensures adherence to local laws and stakeholder sign-off.\nStep 8: Phased Cutover & Monitoring \u2014 perform staged deployment with monitoring and rollback plans.

Rationale: this order establishes a clean single source, aligns integrations and business logic to the new model, and front-loads testing to minimize payroll errors at cutover."
