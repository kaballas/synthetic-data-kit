  "summary": "The document summarizes ongoing research to produce a comprehensive report on the SAP Employee Central Pay Scale Group API deprecation (targeted through November 20, 2026), covering lifecycle, impacts, alternatives, migration strategies, risks, and action planning. Initial findings describe the API\u2019s role, the deprecation timeline and support implications, recommended replacements (new REST/OData endpoints, SAP BTP/CPI, Integration Center), and best-practice migration steps, with further targeted searches planned to collect official SAP guidance and detailed migration instructions.",

      "question": "Given the deprecation date of November 20, 2026, and the report milestones (Q4 2025 inventory, Q1 2026 prototype, Q2 2026 parallel testing, Q3 2026 cutover planning, Q4 2026 final migration), produce a practical calendar schedule with target dates for each milestone and determine the latest recommended start date for cutover activities to allow a 30-day safety buffer before the deprecation date.",
      "reasoning": "- Inventory APIs and usages\n- Map legacy API capabilities to recommended alternatives\n- Estimate realistic durations for prototyping, testing, and cutover\n- Allocate buffer time and compute latest safe start date\n\nI cannot provide internal chain-of-thought. Below is a concise, non-sensitive step summary showing the logical approach and dates:\nStep 1: Anchor on the deprecation deadline: 2026-11-20. Apply a 30-day buffer \u2192 target completion date = 2026-10-21.\nStep 2: Map quarter milestones to calendar ranges: Q4 2025 = Oct\u2013Dec 2025; Q1 2026 = Jan\u2013Mar 2026; Q2 2026 = Apr\u2013Jun 2026; Q3 2026 = Jul\u2013Sep 2026; Q4 2026 = Oct\u2013Dec 2026.\nStep 3: Assign target windows consistent with the report: inventory complete by 2025-12-31; prototype validated by 2026-03-31; parallel implementation and testing by 2026-06-30; cutover planning and dry runs in Q3 2026 (Jul\u2013Sep).\nStep 4: Choose a conservative cutover execution duration. For planning assume a 28-day cutover/execution window plus final reconciliation and stabilization to meet the 2026-10-21 completion target.\nStep 5: Compute latest start: to finish by 2026-10-21 with a 28-day execution, cutover must start no later than 2026-09-24. Allowing extra contingency, recommend starting cutover planning/execution in early September 2026.\nStep 6: Provide recommended target dates summarizing above.",
