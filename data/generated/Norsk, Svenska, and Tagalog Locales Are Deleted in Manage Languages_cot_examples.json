  "summary": "The document summarizes that the Manage Languages tool is a localization management system and describes the Norsk (no_NO), Svenska (sv_SE), and Tagalog (tl_PH) locales (language/region codes, formatting rules, and UI localization roles). It reports those locales entered End of Development on Nov 17, 2023 and were deleted from the tool on May 16, 2025 after usage and cost analyses. It also outlines user impacts (loss of direct language support), mitigation options (fallback locales, migration tools, communications), and recommended best practices for locale lifecycle management.",
