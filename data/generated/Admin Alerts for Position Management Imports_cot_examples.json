  "summary": "The document explains that the Admin Alerts tool (introduced in 1H 2025) replaces the legacy Import Queue Monitor and provides centralized, real\u2011time monitoring of Position Management errors caused by imports and API calls, surfacing detailed metadata (job info sequence, user, position code) and allowing retries and guided remediation. It also describes common error types (hierarchy adaptation, job info save, relationship sync, reclassification, validation, concurrency), how alerts are correlated and categorized, required configuration/permissions, and recommended operational practices to speed resolution and improve oversight.",
