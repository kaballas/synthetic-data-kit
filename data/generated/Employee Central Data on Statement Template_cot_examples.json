  "summary": "The 1H 2025 enhancement lets compensation and variable-pay statement templates reference Employee Central (EC) fields directly (choose \u201cPlan\u201d vs \u201cEmployee Central\u201d when adding fields), so templates dynamically bind to effective\u2011dated EC data without embedding those fields in the compensation plan\u2014reducing plan complexity and improving accuracy, performance, and template flexibility across compensation, variable-pay, and combined statements.  \n\nActivation requires role\u2011based permissions, metadata/security sync and careful testing; some EC root objects and data types remain unsupported and may require workarounds.",

How should they migrate to the 1H 2025 enhancement to minimize maintenance and ensure correct permissions, and what is the qualitative reduction in duplication and maintenance effort after migration?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Quantify duplication: 50 plans \u00d7 120 fields = 6,000 embedded instances versus 120 central EC fields.\nStep 2: Audit and design: inventory all embedded EC-related fields in plans; map them to canonical EC attributes; identify unsupported EC types.\nStep 3: Migrate templates: remove duplicated fields from plans; update statement templates to add fields from the 'Employee Central' data source instead of plan fields.\nStep 4: Metadata & permissions: synchronize EC metadata into statement templates; implement role-based access so only authorized editors/viewers see EC fields.\nStep 5: Test & validate: validate template rendering and data accuracy in non-production across sample employees and effective dates; verify audit trails and GDPR controls.\nStep 6: Expected qualitative impact: duplication drops from 6,000 instances to 120 central attributes; maintenance overhead for field changes shifts from updating many plans to updating a single EC source, yielding an approximate >98% reduction in per-field plan maintenance effort and substantially fewer sync errors.",
      "answer": "Migrate by auditing duplicated fields, removing them from plans, and updating templates to reference EC fields with synced metadata and role-based permissions; duplication falls from 6,000 instances to 120 central fields, yielding a qualitative maintenance reduction of roughly the same magnitude (>98% per-field effort) and improved data accuracy and governance."

      "answer": "Enable EC effective-dated records, configure statement templates to bind EC data using the statement effective date, sync metadata and permissions, then validate historical statement output in non-production so the generated statements reflect the employee's status on the chosen past date."
