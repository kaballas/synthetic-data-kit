  "summary": "The X-SF-Correlation-Id header was a SAP-specific request-correlation header used for tracing SuccessFactors API calls; SAP deprecated it (end of development late 2022) and plans to remove it by May 15, 2026, asking customers to switch to the standard X-Correlation-Id. To avoid loss of end-to-end traceability, customers should inventory and update integrations, middleware, logging and monitoring to propagate and log X-Correlation-Id, validate end-to-end traces (or adopt OpenTelemetry-style tracing), and run thorough regression tests during the migration.",

Each affected service calls 4 downstream services and each integration pair requires 2 hours of cross-service testing. What is the total person-hours required to migrate all affected services, how many person-days is that (8-hour day), and approximately how long in calendar workdays if 3 engineers perform the work in parallel?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Determine number of affected services: 120 * 0.30 = 36 services.\nStep 2: Calculate update work: 36 services * 6 hours/service = 216 person-hours.\nStep 3: Count integration pairs to test: 36 services * 4 downstream calls/service = 144 integration links.\nStep 4: Calculate testing hours: 144 links * 2 hours/link = 288 person-hours.\nStep 5: Sum total person-hours: 216 + 288 = 504 person-hours.\nStep 6: Convert to person-days (8 hours/day): 504 / 8 = 63 person-days.\nStep 7: With 3 engineers in parallel, calendar workdays \u2248 63 / 3 = 21 working days (about 1 month).",
