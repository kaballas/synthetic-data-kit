      "reasoning": "- Identify impacted objects and rules (Compensation Information, linked pay components, allowance enrollment flows).\n- Map data dependencies and validations normally performed by onSave rules.\n- Design compensatory validations, approvals, and audit logging to run in place of onSave.\n- Define implementation and test sequence to deploy controls safely.\n\nStep 1: Determine scope \u2014 list every compensation field and related benefit object that onSave rules would touch during allowance enrollment (e.g., pay components, totals, eligibility flags, job info links). Step 2: For each field, note the validation or calculation the onSave rule enforced (e.g., pay-component limits, alignment with pay scale, eligibility checks). Step 3: Group validations into categories: critical data integrity (must-run), business-policy (should-run), and informational (nice-to-have). Step 4: For critical validations, design compensatory mechanisms: pre-save validations in the enrollment UI, server-side batch validators triggered post-save, or synchronous middleware checks that reject or flag inconsistent records. Step 5: Implement explicit approval workflows for changes that previously auto-triggered approvals; ensure role-based approvers are assigned and notifications created. Step 6: Add audit logging for all enrollment and compensation changes (who, what, when, reason) and retain logs for compliance. Step 7: Sequence deployment \u2014 start with non-production: (a) enable compensatory validators, (b) run parallel processing to compare outcomes with original onSave behavior, (c) enable approvals and logging, (d) gradually roll out to production with heightened monitoring. Step 8: Establish KPIs and monitoring (error rates, manual corrections, processing time) and a rollback/mitigation plan if issues exceed thresholds.",
