  "summary": "The document summarizes the SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Diagnostic Tool and 1H 2025 enhancements that strengthen process\u2011automation monitoring and troubleshooting\u2014notably color\u2011coded change tracking, new transaction/workflow columns, a Set Timestamp control, purge status, mass\u2011data processing, and centralized validation services. These updates increase granular issue detection, logging, and root\u2011cause analysis while integrating with workflows, payroll, Story Reports, and APIs to improve automated resolution, efficiency, and user satisfaction, with the report also noting limitations and mitigation strategies.",
