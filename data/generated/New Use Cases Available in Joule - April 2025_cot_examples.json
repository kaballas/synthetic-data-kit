  "summary": "The document summarizes SAP Joule as an AI-powered copilot embedded across SAP BTP and modules (notably SuccessFactors Employee Central and Recruiting, S/4HANA, Ariba, and SAP Analytics Cloud) that offers natural\u2011language querying, smart recommendations, task automation, context\u2011aware insights, and cross\u2011module workflows. The April 2025 updates emphasize enhanced candidate recommendations, automated recruiting and onboarding workflows, platform admin assistance, multi\u2011language support, and transactional S/4HANA use cases. It also outlines Joule\u2019s architecture (fine\u2011tuned LLMs, contextual AI, and AI agents), guiding principles (embedded intelligence, explainability, governance, continuous learning), and early reported benefits such as reduced time\u2011to\u2011hire and improved candidate experience.",

      "question": "If an organization has a baseline average time-to-hire of 50 days, and Joule delivers the following process improvements: automated screening cuts screening time by 50% (screening accounts for 30% of the total process), interview scheduling automation cuts scheduling time by 80% (scheduling accounts for 10% of the process), and onboarding automation reduces post-offer cycle by 35% (post-offer accounts for 10% of the process).
