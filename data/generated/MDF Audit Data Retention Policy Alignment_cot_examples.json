  "summary": "The document outlines a plan to perform a focused search and produce a detailed report on MDF audit data retention in SAP SuccessFactors, covering definitions, scope, global policy structure, historical gaps, management tools, compliance implications, standards, governance, integration, and recommended improvements. The next step is a targeted search on MDF audit data retention policy alignment with the global SuccessFactors policy and the tools/processes used for enforcement and governance to form the basis of the full analysis.",

      "question": "Given a global SuccessFactors retention policy of 5 years, a regional law requiring 6 years, and an internal audit rule requiring 3 years, what retention period should be configured for MDF audit logs and how should legal holds be handled?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - Identify all applicable retention constraints from the text.\n  - Determine which constraint is controlling under compliance rules.\n  - Account for legal-hold exceptions and operational controls.\n  - Produce an actionable retention configuration and handling rules.\n\nStep 1: Extract constraints described in the prompt: global policy = 5 years, regional law = 6 years, internal audit = 3 years.\nStep 2: Apply the principle from the text that retention must satisfy the most stringent applicable legal/regulatory requirement (i.e., the longest required retention when multiple laws apply).\nStep 3: Compare values: 6 years (regional) > 5 years (global) > 3 years (audit). Therefore the regional law controls retention length.\nStep 4: Add legal-hold handling: the text notes legal holds prevent deletion during investigations; therefore retention must allow preservation beyond the configured retention while a hold is active.\nStep 5: Translate to system configuration: set MDF audit-log retention policy to 6 years by default, implement legal-hold flags that suspend purge jobs for held records, and log hold start/end with auditability.\n\nThis reasoning follows the alignment and governance principles described in the provided material (use longest applicable retention and preserve data under legal hold).",
      "answer": "Configure MDF audit-log retention to 6 years (the longest applicable requirement). Implement legal-hold controls that suspend deletion until the hold is released, with audited hold metadata."

      "question": "If MDF audit logs grow at 8 GB per month and the aligned retention policy keeps logs for 4 years, what is the steady-state storage requirement and what should the monthly archival/deletion volumes be if archival moves data older than 24 months to cold storage and deletion occurs 30 days after archival?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - Quantify monthly growth and annualize it.\n  - Compute total retained data for the configured retention window.\n  - Determine steady-state monthly archival and deletion volumes given the archival/deletion rules.\n  - Summarize operational actions to implement the policy.\n\nStep 1: Monthly growth = 8 GB/month. Annual growth = 8 GB \u00d7 12 = 96 GB/year.\nStep 2: Retention window = 4 years \u2192 steady-state retained data = 96 GB/year \u00d7 4 years = 384 GB.\nStep 3: Archival policy moves data older than 24 months to cold storage. In steady state, each month the system will archive the data that becomes older than 24 months, which equals one month of logs = 8 GB archived per month.\nStep 4: Deletion occurs 30 days after archival. After the 30-day delay, the same archived monthly slice (8 GB) will be deleted each month once the pipeline reaches steady cadence. So monthly deletion volume = 8 GB (subject to the 30-day lag).\nStep 5: Operational recommendations based on the text: provision ~384 GB of primary/active storage, plan cold-storage for archived data and a 30-day retention buffer, and schedule monthly archive jobs of ~8 GB and monthly delete jobs of ~8 GB after the buffer period. Ensure auditability and legal-hold exceptions prevent deletion when required.\n\nThese steps align with the document\u2019s emphasis on automated lifecycle jobs, auditing, and legal-hold controls when enforcing aligned retention policies.",
      "answer": "Steady-state storage \u2248 384 GB. Monthly archival \u2248 8 GB and monthly deletion \u2248 8 GB (with a 30-day delay after archival). Provision active + cold storage and enforce legal-hold exceptions."
