  "summary": "The document explains that SAP\u2019s \"alumni experience\" adds former employees to the global header People Search so authorized administrators can find, view, and manage alumni profiles (personal, employment, payroll) when enabled via provisioning and proper permissions. It outlines the alumni role lifecycle, backend/frontend changes, compliance controls (RBAC, GDPR, IAS), admin workflows for rehiring and auditing, data synchronization practices, and notes limitations such as UI clarity, search performance, and role-transition complexity.",

      "answer": "Enable the alumni provisioning flags (including \"Enable Offboarding with Alumni Experience\" and show inactive/external users), grant the configuring admin the required provisioning permission(s) (e.g., \"Manage System Properties Company System and Logo Settings\"), lock alumni visibility via RBAC and IP/access-window restrictions, ensure HRIS syncs alumni role assignments, and validate via controlled tests and audit logs."

Concise summary of steps:\n1) Determine the desired rehiring policy (merge historical data vs. create fresh record) and document it.\n2) Configure alumni role expiration and rehire workflows in provisioning and Intelligent Services so role transitions trigger the correct path.\n3) For merging: identify fields to retain (historical employment, payroll, credentials) and implement mappings/rules in synchronization and data merge routines to avoid duplicates.\n4) For fresh start: ensure historical records are archived and access controlled, and configure onboarding to create a new employment instance without overwriting archived data.\n5) Run reconciliation and integrity checks post-rehire to confirm merged records are consistent; keep audit trails for changes and provide a rollback plan for mistakes.",

Concise summary of steps:\n1) Apply RBAC so only authorized administrator roles can see alumni entries in search results.\n2) Enable consent management and retention rules for alumni data; surface only permitted fields per consent and legal basis.\n3) Use IP/location restrictions and access window controls to further restrict when and where alumni data can be accessed.\n4) Ensure audit logging is enabled to capture who accessed alumni records, when, and what was viewed or changed.\n5) Regularly run data synchronization and purge/retention processes to comply with data minimization and erasure requirements.",
