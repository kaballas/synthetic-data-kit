  "summary": "The initial search found recent, broadly relevant 2025 information on AI-assisted writing and AI tools in HR\u2014particularly around use cases, trends, and SAP SuccessFactors integrations\u2014but the inquiry is deep and requires more targeted, structured research. Next steps outline focused searches on SAP-specific AI writing integrations, impacts across HR processes (recruiting, onboarding, compensation, succession), training/ethical/compliance practices, adoption challenges, competitor comparisons, emerging trends, and measurable ROI; the investigator will proceed to gather and synthesize a comprehensive, detailed report.",
