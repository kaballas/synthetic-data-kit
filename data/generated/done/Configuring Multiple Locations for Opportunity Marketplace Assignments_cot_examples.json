  "summary": "SAP Opportunity Marketplace (OMP) is a centralized talent-development hub that lets admins configure diverse assignment types (on-site, remote, hybrid, multi-location) and use location parameters to filter, match, and govern visibility and approval workflows. Multi-location support improves matching and internal mobility but requires Employee Central/master-data integration, strict data governance, and careful UI/workflow design to avoid issues like inconsistent location data, confusing filters, and performance or integration problems.",

      "question": "How should an assignment be configured in OMP so it is visible to employees in three non-contiguous countries and to remote workers, while minimizing irrelevant search results?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify relevant report sections on multi-location and flexible assignments\n- Extract constraints: three specific countries + remote workers\n- Map configuration objects: location attributes, eligibility rules, tags, and UI filters\n- Recommend data governance and testing steps\n\nI can\u2019t provide internal chain-of-thought, but here is a concise, actionable summary of the approach:\nStep 1: Ensure the location master data in Employee Central contains standardized entries for the three countries and a distinct \"Remote\" or \"Flexible\" location tag.\nStep 2: Create the assignment with multiple location attributes: explicitly attach the three country location entries and add the \"Remote\" tag as an allowed option.\nStep 3: Define eligibility rules using OR logic so that matching any one of the three country locations or the Remote tag makes the assignment visible to a user.\nStep 4: Configure UI filters to let users narrow by country or remote; add a preference field so user-preferred locations are considered by recommendations.\nStep 5: Apply data governance checks and run test cases with employees in each country and remote profiles to validate visibility and reduce noise.\n\nThis provides the configuration blueprint without internal deliberation.",
      "answer": "Add the three country locations plus a distinct \"Remote\" tag to the assignment, use OR-based eligibility rules, expose country/remote filters in the UI, and validate with data governance and tests."
