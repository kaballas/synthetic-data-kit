  "summary": "The document outlines a plan to research SAP SuccessFactors Learning\u2019s Open Content Network (OCN) and the system property autoRecordAttributeRatingOnItemCompletionEnabled[default] across 10 focused topics (definitions, import workflows, APIs, bulk management, impacts, and best practices). Initial searches and SAP docs confirm OCN integrates external MOOC content into SAP Learning and that the property controls automatic competency-attribute rating on item completion (configurable per item or in bulk), with implementation likely requiring admin configuration or API-driven metadata updates and further technical details from official guides.",
