  "summary": "The document explains SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central workflows and the shift from employment-based to person-based approver replacement, where approvers are resolved by person ID and substituted (typically by their manager) during workflow processing to prevent self-approval. It details the mechanics, scope (approvers, contributors, CCs with specific exemptions), triggers, limitations, and configuration implications. The change strengthens controls and auditability, improving stability and compliance, and the report recommends maintaining accurate manager data and avoiding manual overrides.",

      "question": "An employee (User A) has two active employments: Employment 1 (E1) with Manager M1 and Employment 2 (E2) with Manager M2. User A initiates a workflow from E1. The workflow resolves the approver as User A via a role tied to E2. Under the person-based approver replacement rules, who will be the actual approver and why?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify applicable resolution context (person vs employment).\n- Apply person-based replacement rule: if approver person ID == subject person ID, replace approver by that approver's manager from their active employment.\n- Check exceptions (Self, Manager, Manager Manager, Employee HR roles) \u2014 none apply here.\n- Conclude final approver and rationale.\n\nStep 1: The approver resolved to the same person as the workflow subject (User A), even though via a different employment (E2).\nStep 2: Under person-based logic, the system compares person IDs, not employment IDs, so this is treated as self-approval and triggers replacement.\nStep 3: The system replaces the approver with the approver's manager determined from the approver's active employment assignment. Since the approver is User A in E2, the replacement manager is M2 (User A's manager for E2).\nStep 4: No listed exceptions (Self, Manager, Manager Manager, Employee HR) apply to prevent replacement, so replacement stands.\n\nConclusion: The actual approver will be M2, the manager of User A for Employment 2, because person-based replacement substitutes the approver by their manager when the approver equals the subject user.",
