  "summary": "The document outlines a research plan covering ten questions with emphasis on best practices for designing, implementing, and governing additional custom fields in SAP Compensation and Variable Pay guideline criteria, starting by collecting foundational and technical details about compensation, variable pay, and total compensation templates and their guideline criteria. Preliminary findings show total compensation templates unify salary, variable pay, and stock, that guideline criteria govern eligibility and calculation logic and are highly customizable (including custom fields and XML template uploads), and the next steps focus on technical configuration, metadata/validation, payroll/reporting integration, impacts/risks, evaluation metrics, and governance.",

      "reasoning": "- Step 1: Define the business requirement and scope: document why the field is needed, its allowed values, and stakeholders (HR, payroll, legal, IT).\n- Step 2: Specify metadata and validations: choose data type, length, value list (fixed lookup or dynamic), mandatory vs optional, default values, and validation rules to prevent bad data.\n- Step 3: Map to master data and payroll/reporting: plan field mapping from Employee Central (or HR source) to compensation template; identify transformation rules and payroll fields to update; verify reporting schemas.\n- Step 4: Configure in SAP templates: add the custom field in Employee Central and the plan template XML, create lookup tables/route maps, and reference the field in guideline criteria and calculation logic.\n- Step 5: Implement security and governance: set permissions, audit logging, and documented ownership for the field and its permissible changes.\n- Step 6: Test thoroughly: unit tests, integration tests with payroll and reporting, UAT with planners, and a pilot in one business unit.\n- Step 7: Deploy with upgrade-safe controls: minimize intrusive changes, use SAP-supported extension points, document configuration, maintain XML backups, and include the field in release/upgrade testing.\n- Step 8: Operate and monitor: collect usage metrics, validate data regularly, and periodically reassess necessity to avoid over-customization.",
      "answer": "Design the field from business needs, define strict metadata/validation, map and integrate with master data and payroll, configure lookups and guideline criteria in the template, enforce security and governance, test and pilot, and maintain upgrade-safe practices and ongoing monitoring."

      "question": "If adding 8 custom fields increases processing by 0.5 seconds per field per employee, and a planner reviews 200 employees per session, what is the added session latency and what mitigations will keep added latency under 30 seconds?",
      "reasoning": "- Step 1: Compute per-employee added time: 8 fields * 0.5 s/field = 4.0 s per employee.\n- Step 2: Compute per-session added time: 4.0 s/employee * 200 employees = 800 s per session (which is 13 minutes 20 seconds).\n- Step 3: Determine allowed per-employee added time for 30 s total: 30 s / 200 employees = 0.15 s per employee.\n- Step 4: Determine required per-field latency to meet that target: 0.15 s/employee / 8 fields = 0.01875 s per field (\u224819 ms).\n- Step 5: Identify practical mitigations to reach the target: reduce number of fields; cache lookup/route table results; precompute/aggregate field values server-side; lazy-load or paginate employee lists so only subsets are evaluated; optimize template XML and calculation logic; batch processing; and performance testing with realistic data.\n- Step 6: Recommend combination approach: use caching and server-side precomputation first, paginate planner views, and remove non-essential fields.",
      "answer": "Added latency \u2248 800 seconds (~13m20s). To keep added latency under 30 seconds, per-field latency must be \u2264~19 ms (or greatly reduce field count).
