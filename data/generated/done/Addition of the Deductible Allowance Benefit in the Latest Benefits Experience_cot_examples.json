  "summary": "The document defines the \"deductible allowance benefit\" as an employee-paid deduction mechanism used to allocate portions of pay toward shared benefit costs, manage eligibility, and ensure accurate payroll integration across global benefit frameworks. It describes how SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central\u2019s Configure Benefit Enrollment Process supports this benefit via eligibility rules, deduction configurations, enrollment workflows, and payroll integrations, and it outlines common implementation challenges (complex eligibility, payroll inconsistencies, compliance) and best practices (sandbox testing, clear communication, reconciliation). The report emphasizes careful configuration, staged rollouts, and use of SAP validation tools to reduce errors and improve the employee experience.",

      "question": "An employee enrolls in a deductible allowance that charges a fixed $50 monthly plus 2% of gross pay. If gross pay is $5,000/month and the employee takes one unpaid month (no deductions that month), what is the total annual deduction?",
