  "summary": "The report analyzes the \"Configure Assignments\" feature in SAP Opportunity Marketplace, showing administrators can create and manage assignment types (name, status, max duration, default image), add localized descriptions, and transport configurations via unique IDs. It describes admin UI workflows, underlying metadata and integration points with modules like LMS, Recruiting, and the Capability Portfolio, and explains effects on UX, searchability, and recommendation engines. The document also provides best practices for concise, translated descriptions to improve discoverability, matching, and workforce planning.",

A user with French locale browses the marketplace and an assignment creator does not upload any image. Which assignment types are available for creation in French and which ones will display a default background image on the assignment details page?",

Given statuses, active types are A, C, E, F.\nStep 2: For display language, types lacking a French translation (C and E) will show their default language; they still remain available but without localized descriptions.\nStep 3: Default background images appear when the administrator uploaded one for the assignment type and the creator does not upload an image. Types with uploaded default images are A, D, F. Among active types, A and F have defaults; C and E do not.\nStep 4: Combine conclusions: available in French locale = A, C, E, F (active ones).
