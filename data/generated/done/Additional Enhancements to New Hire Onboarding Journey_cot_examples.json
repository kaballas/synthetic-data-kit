  "summary": "The updated \"Your Onboarding Checklist\" is a centralized, task\u2011centric dashboard for new hires, managers, and HR that streamlines onboarding with progress tracking, role\u2011based task displays, SSO/identity integration, e\u2011signatures and tight connections to SuccessFactors modules for seamless data flow. Implemented via phased deployment, stakeholder engagement, role\u2011based customization and testing, it drives higher engagement, faster time\u2011to\u2011productivity and better compliance while common risks (integration hurdles, adoption resistance, content overload) are mitigated through planning, training and iterative rollout.",

      "answer": "Schedule (30-day window):\n- Days 0\u20133: Immediate compliance and identity tasks (I-9/tax, identity auth, mandatory HR forms).\n- Days 4\u201310: Core data collection and account setup (personal data, system access, SSO), plus initial manager welcome and buddy assignment.\n- Days 11\u201320: Role-specific mandatory training and document reviews required for first 30 days.\n- Days 21\u201327: Manager check-in, practical job shadowing tasks, optional engagement items (social/networking, deeper training modules).\n- Days 28\u201330: Final compliance verifications, analytics review, closeout tasks and feedback survey.\nRationale: Front-load legally required items, chunk remaining work into 7\u201310 day batches to limit overload, and insert manager touchpoints and reminders to keep progress on track."
