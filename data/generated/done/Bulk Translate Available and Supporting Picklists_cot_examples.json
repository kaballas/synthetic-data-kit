  "summary": "Bulk Translate is an AI-driven SAP Business AI feature for mass localization of predefined content (notably picklists), integrated with SAP localization modules to extract source content, translate into multiple target languages, allow user review/edits, and persist validated translations back into MDF/OData-backed repositories. It leverages SAP MT engines plus newer LLMs (54+ languages, ~2,800 pairs) to balance domain-accurate terminology and broader language coverage while maintaining mappings via external IDs, validation rules, and synchronization for consistent deployment.",

If no stable external code exists, derive a composite key from immutable attributes (e.g., option value + external ID pattern + creation timestamp).\nStep 3: Normalize and reconcile labels and metadata across environments, recording one-to-many or missing mappings.\nStep 4: For unmatched items, add a manual reconciliation step: confirm intended equivalence or create missing options in target environments with preserved external codes.\nStep 5: Run validation: compare counts, verify every source option has a mapped target entry, and ensure datatype/length constraints are respected.\nStep 6: Perform a dry-run Bulk Translate using the mapping table, inspect translated labels, and allow post-translation edits.\nStep 7: Import translations using the mapping table so translated labels attach to the correct target option external codes; log mismatches and halt on critical inconsistencies.\nStep 8: After import, execute synchronization tests in target environments and run regression checks in interfaces that consume the picklists.",
      "answer": "Use stable external codes or composite business keys to build a canonical mapping table, reconcile unmatched items manually, validate counts and constraints, run a dry-run translation and review, then import translations using the mapping table and perform post-import synchronization and validation."
