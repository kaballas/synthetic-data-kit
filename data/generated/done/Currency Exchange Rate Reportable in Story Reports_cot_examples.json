  "summary": "The document summarizes standard accounting rules (ASC 830 / IAS 21) and common translation methods (Current Rate and Temporal), noting assets and liabilities are translated at balance-sheet-date rates while revenues/expenses use transaction-specific or period-weighted average rates. It also states real-time and historical rates are sourced from providers like Bloomberg, Reuters, and central banks, that enterprise systems (e.g., SAP) ingest these feeds or internal treasury rates on regular schedules, and that further research into SAP Employee Central and People Analytics currency conversion support is in progress.",

      "reasoning": "- Step 1: For balance-sheet assets and liabilities, use the exchange rate at the balance sheet date per ASC 830.\n- Step 2: For revenues and expenses, use transaction-date rates where available; otherwise use a period-weighted average (monthly or quarterly) to reflect recognition timing.\n- Step 3: Determine whether to apply the Current Rate Method or the Temporal Method based on the subsidiary's functional currency relative to the parent.\n- Step 4: Source rates from trusted providers (Bloomberg/Reuters/central bank) and ensure effective-dated rates are stored for auditability.\n- Step 5: Apply consistent rounding and reconciliation procedures and document rate sources and methods for disclosure.",
      "answer": "Translate assets/liabilities at the quarter-end (balance-sheet) spot rate; translate revenue/expenses using transaction-date rates or a vetted period-weighted average; choose Current Rate vs Temporal method per functional-currency rules; source effective-dated rates from trusted vendors and document the approach."
