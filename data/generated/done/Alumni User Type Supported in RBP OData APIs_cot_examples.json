Preliminary findings show alumni users are a distinct, time\u2011bound lifecycle state supported by RBP OData APIs (including 1H 2025 Alumni Experience features) for lifecycle transitions, role assignments, security controls and auditing, with recommended practices of least\u2011privilege, automation, and careful IAM synchronization.",
