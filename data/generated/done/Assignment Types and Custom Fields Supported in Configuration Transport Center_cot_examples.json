  "summary": "The document defines Assignment Types (categories of projects/roles) and Custom Fields in the SAP Opportunity Marketplace, explaining how they are created, identified by unique IDs, and applied across assignments. It describes the Configuration Transport Center as a centralized tool to package, export, and import these non-code configuration objects across SAP instances using metadata/versioning and integration with the SAP transport system, improving consistency, governance, and upgrade compatibility. It also covers prerequisites, dependencies, common errors (e.g., missing IDs, permissions, version conflicts) and recommended best practices (validation, logging, controlled deployments) for reliable transports.",
