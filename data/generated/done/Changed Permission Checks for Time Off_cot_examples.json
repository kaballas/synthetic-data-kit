  "summary": "The document explains purchase leave (buying extra leave) and payout leave (monetizing unused leave) in SAP Employee Central and describes the original RBAC-based permission model, which was complex and often required overly broad permissions for employees, managers, and HR admins. It then details a recent update that refactors and reduces permission checks to a minimal, focused set\u2014reducing configuration errors and exposure\u2014and recommends administrators review and update role templates, workflows, and documentation.",
