  "summary": "The document explains that Chrome's unload lifecycle is governed mainly by the cancellable beforeunload (used to prompt about unsaved changes via event.preventDefault()/returnValue) and the less-reliable unload (used for cleanup), and that modern browsers impose strict timing, security, and visibility constraints on these handlers. It summarizes historical flags and changes (e.g., bfcache incompatibility and chrome://flags/#back-forward-cache), notes deprecation trends, and highlights a shift toward safer alternatives like the Page Lifecycle API, visibilitychange, and platform-specific patterns referenced by sources such as SAP Learning.",

      "question": "Given a learning platform with 60% mobile users and 40% desktop users: before the Chrome extended unload configuration the save-on-unload success rates were 60% on mobile and 95% on desktop. After enabling the extended unload configuration the success rates became 85% on mobile and 96% on desktop. What are the overall save-on-unload success rates before and after, and what are the absolute and relative improvements?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify user distribution and per-platform success rates.\n- Compute weighted overall success before the configuration.\n- Compute weighted overall success after the configuration.\n- Calculate absolute improvement (percentage points) and relative improvement (percent).\nStep 1: Previous overall success = 0.6*0.60 + 0.4*0.95 = 0.36 + 0.38 = 0.74 (74%).\nStep 2: New overall success = 0.6*0.85 + 0.4*0.96 = 0.51 + 0.384 = 0.894 (89.4%).\nStep 3: Absolute improvement = 89.4% - 74% = 15.4 percentage points.\nStep 4: Relative improvement = 15.4 / 74 \u2248 0.208 = 20.8%.",

The telemetry states 99% of unload handlers finish within 6 s, so achieving >=99% reliability requires a timeout of at least 6 s.\nStep 2: Compute performance penalty using the linear model. The penalty applies to seconds beyond 2 s. For a 6 s timeout, extra seconds = 6 - 2 = 4 s. Penalty = 4 s * 0.5%/s = 2.0%.\nStep 3: Compare to constraints. Reliability = 99% (meets >=99% requirement). Performance penalty = 2.0% (meets <=2% requirement, exactly at the limit).\nStep 4: Operational recommendation.
