      "question": "If an administrator recalls a Rewards Statement after it was generated but before employees open it, what sequence of checks determines whether the related Homepage Card is deleted, hidden, or remains visible to users?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps to apply:\n  - Identify the recall type and scope.\n  - Verify the linkage between the statement and its homepage card.\n  - Inspect synchronization and background job behavior.\n  - Confirm role/permission and visibility rules.\n  - Correlate timestamps and system events to validate outcome.\n\nStep 1: Determine recall type and scope \u2014 whether the recall is a logical 'revoke distribution' (soft recall) or a full removal from the system (hard delete), and whether it targets all recipients or a subset.\nStep 2: Verify how homepage cards are generated \u2014 check if the card is directly tied to the persisted Rewards Statement object or to a transient distribution event. If the card references the persisted statement ID, a removal of that object or a change of its status likely affects the card.\nStep 3: Inspect synchronization mechanisms \u2014 identify the background job or event bus that updates homepage cards after statement changes. If a recall triggers that job (or an explicit event), the card will be updated/removed; if not, the card may remain until the next sync or manual cleanup.\nStep 4: Check visibility rules and permissions \u2014 some configurations hide cards for users lacking view permissions even if the underlying card exists; role-based filters or audience rules can change whether a card is visible after a recall.\nStep 5: Correlate logs and timestamps \u2014 review audit logs, statement lifecycle events, and card update timestamps to confirm whether the recall initiated a deletion/hide action or left the card unchanged.\nStep 6: Conclude probable outcomes \u2014 if recall triggers a deletion event on the statement and the sync job processes that event immediately, the homepage card will be deleted; if the system only marks the statement as recalled without emitting card-update events, the card may be hidden by audience rules or remain visible until cleanup.\n\nSummary: Follow the above checks in order to determine the actual behavior in the tenant.",
