  "summary": "The document explains that Form I-9 reverification is a legally required step to confirm continued employment authorization when time\u2011limited work documents expire, historically managed in onboarding systems via manual HR triggers. It describes SAP Onboarding\u2019s manual reverification workflow, notes SAP\u2019s planned removal of that manual trigger (Nov 13, 2026), and recommends transitioning to automated expiration monitoring and workflow-driven reverification to reduce errors, support compliance, and require a controlled implementation and stakeholder change plan.",
