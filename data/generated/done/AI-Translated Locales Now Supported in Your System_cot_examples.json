  "summary": "The document outlines a phased research plan to examine AI\u2011translated locales in SAP SuccessFactors HCM across nine focused areas (features/integration, AI technology, configuration, benefits/limitations, user impact, risks, quality control, roadmap, and strategic implementation), with immediate targeted searches on AI translation technology and language\u2011pack integration. Initial findings indicate SuccessFactors\u2019 AI language packs are modular, API\u2011integrated add\u2011ons that provide context\u2011aware, continuously updated neural machine translations (transformer\u2011based, fine\u2011tuned on HR corpora) with administrative customization and governance to balance speed and translation quality.",

      "question": "Given a phased rollout plan for AI-translated locales in SAP SuccessFactors HCM: a pilot locale requires 6 weeks for configuration, validation, and linguistic review. After a successful pilot, remaining locales can be deployed in parallel by two implementation teams, each team handling up to 2 locales per 3-week wave. If an organization needs 5 locales in total (including the pilot), what is the shortest realistic calendar time to complete full rollout?",
