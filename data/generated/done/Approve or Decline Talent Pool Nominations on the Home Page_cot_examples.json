  "summary": "Searches returned comprehensive documentation and analysis of the SAP SuccessFactors Talent Pool Nominee feature; the report summarizes its functional scope, MDF-based technical architecture and integrations (Succession Org Chart, CDP, Recruiting/Learning), the home-page card UX for pending nominations, and standard nomination workflows and statuses. It also covers underlying data models, business rules and approval logic, roles/permissions, measurable impacts, deployment challenges, and best-practice alignment, and lists targeted follow-up queries for deeper technical details.",

      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps to generate this example:\n  - Identify relevant MDF entities and record types.\n  - Confirm role-based permission checks and validation rules.\n  - Determine status transitions and effective-dating behavior.\n  - Describe system triggers (notifications, locking, development plan linkage).\n\nSummary of approach (non-sensitive):\nStep 1: Identify the nomination as an MDF effective-dated record linked to the talent pool and role.\nStep 2: Verify the approver has RBP permission; the system validates required fields (readiness, comments, effective date).\nStep 3: On approval, the system compares effective dates against existing approved nominations; business rules decide whether to allow overlap, mark prior records as changed/archived, or require re-approval.\nStep 4: The approved nomination transitions Pending -> Approved; if overlap triggers an adjustment, the prior nomination may transition to Changed/Expired/Archived depending on rules.\nStep 5: The system locks the approved record, triggers notifications to stakeholders, and creates/updates linked development plans and audit entries for traceability.\nStep 6: Final state is reflected on the Talent Pool Nominee home page card and Succession views with updated statuses and audit trail.\n",
      "answer": "The system validates permissions and fields, then transitions the nomination Pending -> Approved. It checks effective-date overlap and, per business rules, either adjusts or archives the prior nomination (Changed/Expired/Archived), locks the approved record, updates linked development plans, sends notifications, and records an audit trail."
