  "summary": "The document outlines a focused research plan to fully address AI-assisted candidate interview feedback within SAP Business AI and SAP Recruiting, using targeted queries on core components/terminology, generative AI/NLP methods, and enterprise best practices (bias, privacy, validation). It previews a comprehensive report covering data sources and metrics, preprocessing and model choices, feedback synthesis workflows, bias mitigation and ethics, validation approaches, and a design/deployment framework for generative AI-driven interview feedback to improve candidate experience and hiring outcomes.",
