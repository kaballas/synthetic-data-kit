  "summary": "You plan to compile a comprehensive report on AI-assisted skills inference in SAP Learning by collecting targeted information on core concepts, technical frameworks and models, data inputs and algorithms, bulk skill-association/import mechanisms, and operational benefits and limitations. You will extract detailed content from official SAP Help Center pages about enabling AI-assisted skills inference and associating skills with Open Content Network items, plus a LinkedIn article on next-gen SAP learning. This gathered material will form the foundation for a systematic, evidence-based analysis addressing the first question and parts of the others.",
