  "summary": "The Instance Refresh Tool (IRT) lets administrators schedule and run irreversible data and configuration refreshes from a source to a target SAP SuccessFactors tenant (must be paired and in the same data center), with options for anonymization, monitoring, cancellation before start, and email notifications. Production refreshes require explicit approval (auto-cancel if not approved within 24 hours), disable further refreshes on the production target after completion, and require strict governance and post\u2011refresh validation of integrations, custom code (notably TIH), and anonymization to mitigate permanent overwrite and privacy risks.",

      "question": "If an admin schedules a production-target refresh 48 hours from now but approval is delayed, what is the final state of the refresh request and what steps should be taken to ensure it executes successfully?",
      "reasoning": "- Verify tenant pairing and production-refresh enablement\n- Confirm admin permissions and approver availability\n- Validate anonymization and schedule window\n- Monitor approval timeline and resubmit or re-schedule if canceled\n\nStep 1: Confirm prerequisite status: ensure source and target tenants are paired, reside in the same data center, and the customer's instance has production-refresh enabled by SAP Support. Without these, the request cannot execute.\nStep 2: Check permissions: confirm both requester and approver accounts have IRT refresh permissions; if approver lacks rights, approval will not happen.\nStep 3: Understand the auto-cancel rule: the tool auto-cancels any unapproved request within 24 hours of its scheduled start time. Scheduling 48 hours ahead means approval must occur no later than 24 hours before the scheduled time.\nStep 4: Plan approvals: notify approvers immediately and provide required impact details (anonymization settings, modules selected, maintenance window). Set automated reminders so approval happens within the required window.\nStep 5: If approval is missed and the request auto-cancels, either re-initiate a new refresh request with corrected timing/approver assignment or reschedule with adequate lead time; ensure stakeholders are alerted to avoid repeated cancellations.\nStep 6: Before the scheduled execution, validate integrations and backups outside IRT and prepare the post-refresh validation checklist.\n\n(Short reasoning summary provided; detailed internal deliberation withheld.)",
      "answer": "The request will auto-cancel if not approved within 24 hours of its scheduled start. To ensure execution: verify tenant pairing and enablement, confirm approver permissions, notify approvers immediately, set reminders, and if canceled re-submit or reschedule with proper approvals and pre- and post-refresh validation."

      "question": "During a refresh where the source tenant lacks TIH settings but the target has TIH configured, what will happen to TIH on the target and what pre- and post-refresh actions should be planned to avoid service disruption?",
      "reasoning": "- Check TIH presence on source and target tenants\n- Plan backup/export of TIH configuration from target if needed\n- Include TIH reconfiguration steps in post-refresh checklist\n- Coordinate with integration owners for reauthorization\n\nStep 1: Identify TIH state: verify that the source tenant indeed lacks TIH configuration and the target currently has TIH configured.\nStep 2: Apply tool behavior: the IRT will overwrite target settings with the source. If TIH is absent on the source, TIH configurations on the target will be deleted as part of the refresh.\nStep 3: Mitigation before refresh: export or document all TIH settings from the target (configuration, endpoints, credentials) and ensure backups exist outside IRT because attachments and some artifacts are not replicated.\nStep 4: Prepare stakeholders: notify integration owners and schedule a post-refresh reconfiguration window; ensure required credentials and reauthorization processes are available.\nStep 5: Post-refresh validation: immediately reapply TIH settings or run a scripted reconfiguration, validate data flows, and test connected services to confirm TIH-dependent functionality is restored.\nStep 6: Update runbooks: record the TIH restoration steps for future refreshes and include them in the approval checklist.\n\n(Short reasoning summary provided; detailed internal deliberation withheld.)",
      "answer": "TIH settings on the target will be removed if the source lacks TIH. To avoid disruption: export and backup target TIH configs beforehand, plan and perform immediate post-refresh TIH reconfiguration and testing, and document the restoration steps in the approval checklist."

      "reasoning": "- Define roles and minimum approvers per landscape and risk level\n- Require pre-refresh checklist and automated gating rules (pairing, enablement, anonymization)\n- Implement timed approval windows with reminders and auto-cancellation\n- Include post-refresh validation and rollback/restore triggers outside IRT\n\nStep 1: Role definition: assign distinct roles\u2014Requestor (initiates refresh), Technical Approver (validates tenant pairing, data center, integrations), Business Approver (validates timing and business impact), and Compliance Officer (confirms anonymization). For high-risk hybrid or multi-tenant setups, require all four sign-offs.\nStep 2: Pre-approval gating: require an automated pre-check that confirms tenant pairing, production-refresh enablement, and that the selected date is within approved maintenance windows; block submission if any pre-check fails.\nStep 3: Approval timing: enforce an approval window such that final approval must occur no later than 24 hours before the scheduled refresh; configure automated reminders at 72, 48, and 24 hours; configure auto-cancel if final approval is not recorded within 24 hours of execution.\nStep 4: Documentation and ticketing: integrate the refresh request with ITSM so a change ticket (with ID) must be attached; record anonymization settings, modules selected, and a rollback plan (external snapshot or backup location) prior to approval.\nStep 5: Execution controls: allow cancellation up to start time; ensure email notifications go to all approvers at each state change and log actions in audit history.\nStep 6: Post-refresh validation: mandate a defined checklist (integration tests, TIH checks, attachment/audit log verification, third-party reauthorizations) with sign-off from Technical Approver before declaring the refresh successful; if critical failures occur, open an SAP support ticket and initiate restore from external backups.\n\n(Short reasoning summary provided; detailed internal deliberation withheld.)",
