  "summary": "The document summarizes research on Role\u2011Based Permissions in SAP (SuccessFactors), finding that permission categories are typically hierarchical with metadata (name, description, module, status), and that a 2025 update adds an ascending-order sorting checkbox in the Add Permissions UI. It also highlights usability problems with unsorted lists, technical implementation considerations (e.g., backend ORDER BY, indexing, frontend rendering, caching), and concludes that ascending sorting improves administrative efficiency with minimal security impact while recommending deeper analysis of structure, usability, and implementation.",
