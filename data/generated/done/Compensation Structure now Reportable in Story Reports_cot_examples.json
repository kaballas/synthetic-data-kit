  "summary": "The document explains how SAP SuccessFactors\u2019 Compensation Structure is modeled, stored, and exposed within People Analytics Story Reports, enabling detailed reporting of pay components, grades, eligibility, and assignment metadata across Employee Central and compensation modules. It covers data flow and integration, key extractable fields, common limitations (data completeness, complex custom models, performance, historical reporting, and security), and recommended practices such as using the Optimized Design Experience, creating calculated fields, replicating EC fields for joins, frequent refreshes, and strict RBAC. Overall, it frames compensation-structure reporting as a powerful but sensitive capability that requires careful configuration, governance, and performance planning to deliver accurate, actionable insights.",

      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps to generate the example:\n  - Identify required fields and join sources.\n  - Normalize currencies to a reporting currency.\n  - Compute per-employee metrics using standard formulas.\n  - Aggregate metrics and apply privacy controls.\n  - Validate completeness and schedule refreshes.\n\nStep 1: Select and join sources: include Employee Central pay components, pay grade ranges (min, midpoint, max), currency, and assignment metadata (location, legal entity, pay grade).\nStep 2: Normalize currencies: use a validated exchange rate table or field and convert each employee salary and range bounds to a single reporting currency before calculations.\nStep 3: Compute per-employee metrics with concise formulas: $compa\\_ratio = \\frac{current\\_salary}{midpoint}$ and $range\\_penetration = \\frac{current\\_salary - min}{max - min}$ (handle divide-by-zero and nulls).\nStep 4: Aggregate: calculate weighted or simple averages and distribution percentiles by desired dimensions (location, pay grade). Use Story Report calculated measures to produce average compa\u2011ratio and median, plus counts.\nStep 5: Privacy & governance: apply RBAC filters so only authorized roles see individual salaries; use masking or aggregated buckets (e.g., ranges) for broader audiences.\nStep 6: Validate and address limitations: check for missing payroll integration, stale exchange rates, and ensure large joins are optimized or pre-aggregated to avoid performance issues.\n\nConcise rationale: normalize currency first, compute per\u2011employee ratios with the standard formulas, aggregate by desired dimensions, and enforce masking/RBAC before visualizing.",
