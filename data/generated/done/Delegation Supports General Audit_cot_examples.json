      "question": "An administrator account shows ten delegation create-and-revoke cycles for high-privilege scopes within one hour. Using the reportable indicators from delegation audits, how should an analyst assess the incident and what immediate steps should be taken?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Assess indicators: frequency of create/revoke, privilege scope involved, delegator and delegatee identities, timestamps (off-hours?), and whether delegatees are active/authorized.\nStep 2: Correlate with other logs (auth events, admin actions, SIEM alerts) to detect concurrent suspicious activity.\nStep 3: Classify risk: high frequency with high-privilege scope and unusual recipients or off-hours activity -> high risk; otherwise moderate.\nStep 4: Immediate responses for high risk: suspend or restrict the delegator account, preserve and secure audit logs, trigger incident response, and perform root-cause investigation.\nStep 5: For moderate risk: require manager/owner review, revoke suspicious delegations, and increase monitoring and alerting thresholds.",
      "answer": "Treat it as high risk if high-privilege scopes, unusual recipients, or off-hours timing are present; immediately suspend/restrict the delegator, preserve logs, trigger incident response, and investigate; otherwise revoke suspect delegations, require review, and increase monitoring."
