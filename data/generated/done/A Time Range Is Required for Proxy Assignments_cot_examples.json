  "summary": "The document outlines a comprehensive research plan on proxy assignments in SAP Platform IAM, emphasizing mandatory start/end time ranges and covering definitions, use cases, historical evolution, technical implementation, security rationale, and comparisons with other IAM platforms. It also details UI, data-model, backend and import-file changes, best practices, governance and compliance impacts, migration challenges, and operational recommendations for managing time-bounded proxy delegations.",

Policy: low-sensitivity roles get 7-day proxies, high-sensitivity roles get 90-day proxies. If 70% of the 30 legacy proxies are low-sensitivity and 10% of the high-sensitivity legacy assignments cannot be auto-classified and require manual review, how many legacy proxies will be set to 7 days, how many to 90 days, how many will require manual review, and what is the total number of proxies after migration?",
