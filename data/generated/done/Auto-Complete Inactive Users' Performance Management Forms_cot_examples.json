  "summary": "The document summarizes findings that inactive users in SAP Performance Management (typically terminated/transferred accounts) can stall forms and workflows, requiring detection, preservation of historical data, role-based permissions, and admin/API-driven rerouting or auto-completion to maintain process continuity and compliance. It also outlines a research plan to investigate technical definitions, product features/APIs, causes and detection methods, automation and ML options, risks and compliance, SAP best practices/case studies, measurable outcomes, and a comprehensive process design for automating routing and completion of inactive users' forms.",
