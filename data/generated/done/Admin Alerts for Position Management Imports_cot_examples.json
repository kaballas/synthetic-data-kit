  "summary": "The Admin Alerts tool (introduced in 1H 2025) replaces the Import Queue Monitor and centralizes real-time error monitoring for Position Management follow-up processes triggered by imports and API calls, surfacing failures such as hierarchy adaptations, job info save errors, relationship syncs, reclassifications, and data validation or concurrency issues. It groups related errors with correlation IDs, provides detailed metadata and retry actions for remediation, and requires specific Position Management configuration, permissions, and event-publish settings\u2014improving operational oversight and reducing resolution time.",
