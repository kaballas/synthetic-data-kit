  "summary": "The Career Worksheet in SAP SuccessFactors is a Talent & Succession tool that lets employees and managers browse curated job roles, assess role readiness and skill gaps, create development goals, and explore career paths with rich role metadata and open-position integration. The latest release centers on a Growth Portfolio UX with AI-driven recommendations, flexible card/chart browsing, deeper role detail, and governed role\u2011based access to support development, internal mobility, and succession planning.",

      "question": "An employee's Growth Portfolio shows a current role and two potential target roles. Role A has a role readiness score of 68% with skill gaps in 'data analysis' and 'stakeholder communication' and an open internal position listed in the Opportunity Marketplace. Role B has a readiness of 82% with gaps only in 'strategic planning' but no current open positions. Considering internal mobility, organizational opportunity alignment, and career development best practices from the Career Worksheet, which role should be recommended and what development goals should be prioritized?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify relevant inputs from the Growth Portfolio: readiness scores, skill gaps, and open-position availability.\n- Weigh readiness against immediate mobility opportunity (open position) and long-term fit.\n- Consider Career Worksheet best practices (prioritize roles with open positions for timely mobility; use AI insights and development goals to close gaps).\nStep 1: Note readiness \u2014 Role A 68%, Role B 82%.\nStep 2: Note skill gaps \u2014 Role A: data analysis, stakeholder communication; Role B: strategic planning.\nStep 3: Note Opportunity Marketplace \u2014 Role A has an open internal position; Role B currently does not.\nStep 4: Apply organizational mobility principle \u2014 an open position increases practical chance for timely move; readiness can be raised via focused development goals.\nStep 5: Balance short-term mobility vs. long-term fit \u2014 Role A offers immediate mobility despite lower readiness; Role B is closer in readiness but lacks an open role now.\nStep 6: Recommend prioritized development actions that are specific, measurable, and linked to role requirements (learning modules, stretch assignments, mentoring) to close gaps for the chosen recommendation.",
      "answer": "Recommend Role A due to the available open position and reasonable readiness that can be raised. Prioritize development goals: (1) complete a focused data-analysis training and short project to demonstrate applied skills, (2) enroll in a stakeholder-communication workshop and set up a cross-team presentation assignment. Track progress via updated readiness score in the Career Worksheet."

      "question": "HR must identify top successors for a critical leadership role using Career Worksheet browsing. Candidate X: readiness 85% but missing a critical competency flagged by AI; Candidate Y: readiness 75% with strong incumbency experience; Candidate Z: readiness 60% but high potential and strong skill overlap. Which two candidates should be advanced as primary successors and what validation and development steps should HR schedule?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Extract decision criteria from the Career Worksheet context \u2014 readiness scores, AI-flagged competency gaps, incumbency/networking evidence, potential and skill overlap.\nStep 2: Prioritize candidates by readiness tempered by critical competency presence and learnability; incumbency experience increases near-term suitability.\nStep 3: Rank candidates given the constraints: high readiness (X) but critical gap, solid readiness + incumbency (Y), and high potential but lower readiness (Z).\nStep 4: Select top two by combining near-term readiness and fixable gaps: choose X (if critical gap can be remediated quickly) and Y (incumbency and stable readiness) as primary successors; Z remains a development candidate for longer-term pipeline.\nStep 5: Define validation and development actions: targeted competency training and assessment for X, role-shadowing and leadership stretch assignments for Y, and a growth plan for Z with milestones recorded in Career Worksheet.",
      "answer": "Advance Candidates X and Y as the two primary successors. Validation/development steps: for X \u2014 fast-track targeted training and a competency assessment to close the AI-flagged gap; for Y \u2014 role-shadowing, leadership stretch assignments, and confirmation via performance indicators and manager endorsement. Keep Z on a defined development pathway for medium-term succession."
