  "summary": "The document outlines a research plan to investigate how SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding handles document uploads in custom tasks\u2014covering storage/linking, visibility and role-based permissions, integration with the New Hire Details page, APIs/backend synchronization, configuration steps, known limitations, version impacts, and best practices. It proposes targeted searches of technical docs, release notes, and community resources to produce a comprehensive analysis, troubleshooting guidance, and optimization recommendations for making custom-task documents visible and accessible from New Hire Details.",

      "question": "A PDF uploaded in a custom onboarding task is not visible under New Hire Details > Onboarding Documents. What step-by-step diagnostic procedure should an admin follow to identify and fix the root cause?",
      "reasoning": "- Verify MDF attachment field exists for the custom task\n- Confirm the attachment field is mapped in the onboarding template\n- Check Role-Based Permissions (RBP) and Provisioning visibility settings\n- Test upload, synchronization, and API/log outputs\n- Repeat test with known-good configuration\n\nI can't provide internal chain-of-thought, but here is a concise, structured diagnostic procedure:\nStep 1: Confirm MDF attachment field \u2014 open the MDF object for the custom task and verify an attachment-type field exists and is enabled. Expected: field present and configured.\nStep 2: Verify onboarding template mapping \u2014 ensure the custom task uses the MDF field and that the template includes that field in the task layout. Expected: field mapped and visible in template editor.\nStep 3: Check RBP and Provisioning \u2014 confirm roles (Hiring Manager, HR) have 'view' permission on the MDF object and the onboarding instance; confirm Provisioning flags for Onboarding Documents aren\u2019t restricting display. Expected: roles granted read access.\nStep 4: Perform a controlled upload \u2014 upload a test document to the custom task and note uploader, timestamp, and file name.\nStep 5: Inspect synchronization/API/logs \u2014 check backend sync jobs, MDF attachment records, and API responses for the onboarding instance to ensure the attachment metadata is present. Expected: attachment metadata available and pointer to stored file.\nStep 6: Isolate and remediate \u2014 if metadata is missing, recreate/migrate the attachment field and reupload; if metadata exists but UI doesn\u2019t show, clear caches, re-run sync, and verify UI role filters. Expected: document appears in New Hire Details.\nStep 7: Final validation \u2014 test with target user roles to confirm visibility and log results for audit.\n",
      "answer": "Run these checks in order: (1) ensure MDF attachment field exists and is mapped, (2) verify RBP/Provisioning grants view access, (3) perform test upload, (4) inspect sync/API logs for attachment metadata, (5) fix mapping/permissions or rerun sync, and (6) validate visibility with target roles. Most common causes: missing attachment field, incorrect mapping, or insufficient permissions."
