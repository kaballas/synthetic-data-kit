  "summary": "This report reviews how leading HR/recruiting systems structure job requisitions with modular, taxonomy-backed skills metadata and describes mechanisms for copying requisitions while automatically migrating validated skills using ID matching, taxonomy lookups, version checks, and audit logging. It also covers practical challenges (taxonomy divergence, validation mismatches), security and compliance controls (RBAC, audit trails, data governance), user experience impacts, and recommended technical best practices for reliable, auditable skill migration.",
