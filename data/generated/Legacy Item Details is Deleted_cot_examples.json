  "summary": "This document outlines a research plan and consolidated findings about SAP Learning\u2019s deprecated legacy Item Details experience and its replacement by the new Course Home experience, noting an official removal date of May 16, 2025. It summarizes legacy functionality, key UI/feature differences, transition guidance, expected user/admin impacts, and next steps to gather official SAP documentation and community feedback for a comprehensive transition report.",

      "reasoning": "I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I can\u2019t share my internal chain-of-thought. Here is a concise stepwise summary of the logical approach:\nStep 1: Note the hard cutoff: legacy Item Details was removed May 16, 2025, so postponement risks immediate loss of functionality.\nStep 2: Identify likely risks by mapping legacy dependencies described in the text to probable failure modes: (a) user-facing disruption (learners/admins cannot access details they expect), (b) broken integrations/customizations tied to legacy UI, (c) increased support load and training gaps.\nStep 3: For each risk, list mitigations that follow logically from the text: enable and test the new Course Home early; audit and update custom integrations; run pilot groups and provide targeted training; update documentation and support scripts.\nStep 4: Prioritize mitigations by impact/effort: enable/test new UI and sandbox validation first, then fix integrations, then user communications and training.\nStep 5: Define quick success checks: sandbox tests pass, core integrations operational, pilot users report <10% task friction.",
      "answer": "Top 3 risks: (1) learner/admin disruption to item access and enrollment; (2) broken customizations/integrations tied to legacy views; (3) surge in support/training needs.

Here is a concise stepwise summary of the logical approach:\nStep 1: Extract legacy feature set from the text (tabbed metadata, schedules/location/price, attachments, enrollment buttons, detailed admin tabs, certain reporting views).\nStep 2: Identify new Course Home paradigms (card/tile UI, integrated enrollment, browse library, optional curricula integration, mobile-first layout).\nStep 3: Map features: legacy tabs -> tiles/cards with linked sections; schedule/location/price -> course card metadata and expanded details panel; attachments/documents -> documents section linked in Course Home; enrollment actions -> built-in card actions; admin-specific tabs/report views -> admin settings and reporting tools that may require reconfiguration or API-based report recreation.\nStep 4: Recommend rework steps: inventory customizations, map each to new UI element, update API calls or rebuild small UI extensions, validate on sandbox, update documentation.",
      "answer": "Likely-to-rework features: tabbed metadata pages, admin-specific tabs/reports, UI-bound custom scripts, and any integration expecting legacy DOM/API. Mapping approach: tabs -> cards/expanded panels; enrollment buttons -> card actions; documents -> Course Home documents area; reports -> reconfigure via admin reporting or APIs. Mitigation: inventory, map, rebuild integrations, and test in sandbox."

      "answer": "6-week plan:\nWeek 1 (Assess & Enable): Enable Course Home in sandbox; inventory legacy customizations.

Success = critical integrations pass tests.\nWeek 4 (Pilot & Training): Run pilot with representative users and admin testers; deliver focused trainings. Success = pilot users report acceptable usability and no major defects.\nWeek 5 (Org-wide Enablement): Enable Course Home in production, announce change, run org-wide training. Success = production enabled and support materials live.\nWeek 6 (Stabilize & Improve): Monitor adoption, resolve post-go-live issues, gather feedback for improvements.
