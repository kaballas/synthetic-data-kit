  "summary": "The document is a comprehensive report on the Accrual Recalculation Posting Method \"Classic\" in SAP Employee Central Time Management, covering its design, historical adoption, SAP\u2019s deprecation roadmap, alternatives, customer reactions, technical impacts, best practices, and lessons learned. It concludes that SAP will end development in May 2025 and delete the method by December 2025 due to performance and data\u2011volume issues, and recommends migrating to newer approaches (e.g., No Recalculation Postings) with phased pilots, integration checks, and compliance-focused testing.",
