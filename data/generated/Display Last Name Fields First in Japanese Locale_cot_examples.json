  "summary": "The document explains that SAP Employee Central and Recruiting support displaying family name before given name for the Japanese locale, describing the cultural rationale and the localization mechanisms (locale keys, UI configuration, Manage Languages) that enable this behavior. It also outlines a research and implementation plan covering technical configuration, UX impacts, best practices, challenges, and step\u2011by\u2011step guidance for adopting last-name-first display in SAP for Japan.",
