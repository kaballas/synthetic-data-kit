  "summary": "The document outlines a nine-step research plan to produce a comprehensive technical report on deprecated pension-related fields in SAP Employee Central, covering affected fields, timelines, replacement benefit objects, integration/reporting impacts, migration strategies, monitoring, and customer experiences. Preliminary search results show End of Development on May 17, 2024 and scheduled deletion by May 15, 2026 for legacy pension fields and some SOAP APIs, but sources are fragmented and lack the full technical detail needed.",
