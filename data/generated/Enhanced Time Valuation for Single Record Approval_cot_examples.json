It summarizes initial findings (e.g., filtering on single record approval status in input groups, relevant SAP Help and KBA references, and payroll impacts) and states the intent to fetch full content from specified SAP Help/KBA URLs to build the detailed analysis.",

Below is a concise, non-sensitive summary of the logical steps to achieve the outcome:\n\n1. Verify system prerequisites and patch levels (ensure provisioning and releases that include the Single Record Approval Status attribute are applied).\n2. Activate single record approval in Time Tracking and define approval workflows tied to the specific time types that require per-record approvals.\n3. Configure time types and time recording profiles so entries created use the single record approval workflow and appropriate approval period (flexible approval period recommended).\n4. In Time Valuation, add or modify the valuation rule using the type \"Filter Single Records from Input Groups\" and set the attribute \"Single Record Approval Status\" to filter for \"Approved\" only.\n5. Assign the updated time valuation to the relevant time recording profiles and payroll integration points.\n6. Enable and configure cancellation workflows if reversals need approval control.\n7. Execute end-to-end testing in a sandbox: create approved and unapproved single records, run valuation and payroll simulation, verify unapproved records are excluded and approved are included.\n8.

Pre-valuation gating: configure time valuation to filter input groups by Single Record Approval Status = Approved so unapproved entries are excluded from the valuation run.\n4. Valuation verification: after valuation, run checks that count number of input records vs. approved records and flag discrepancies for review.\n5. Payroll integration: only transfer valuation outputs to payroll (not raw single-record inputs); include control totals that reconcile to expected approved-record-derived amounts.\n6. Monitoring and alerts: enable workflow queue monitoring, valuation logs, and reconciliation alerts for unexpected pending approvals close to payroll cutoff.\n7. Exception handling: define operational procedures for late approvals (e.g., off-cycle payroll, manager overrides) and ensure cancellation workflows are controlled.\n8. Post-payroll audit: compare payroll postings to approved-record audit trails and run periodic reconciliations.\n",
