  "summary": "The document summarizes research into SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding rehire and username/identity management, examining identity lifecycle, HCM/ERP/IAM integration, security and compliance, data migration, and user experience for regenerated versus reused usernames. Key findings: SAP Onboarding detects rehires via configurable matching rules and can either reactivate old accounts or generate new usernames \u2014 each option has trade-offs (security and auditability vs user convenience) and requires persistent identifiers, careful integration mapping, migration planning, and clear communication.",
