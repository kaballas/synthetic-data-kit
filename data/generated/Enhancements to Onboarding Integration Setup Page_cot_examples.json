  "summary": "The initial search found fragmented but relevant information and recommends targeted searches across ten specific areas (architecture, rule details, configuration, best practices, integrations, metrics, etc.) organized into three parallel query groups. Preliminary findings indicate the Onboarding Integration Setup now supports an \"Apply Onboarding to Job Requisitions via Business Rule\" option that enables granular, reusable eligibility logic (built in the Business Rules Engine) and outlines typical rule types and basic configuration steps.",
