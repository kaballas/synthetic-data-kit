  "summary": "The document analyzes SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace with emphasis on designing an email-notification system that re-engages users inactive for two weeks by sending non\u2011intelligent (rule-based) opportunity recommendations. It contrasts AI-driven versus static recommendation methods, reviews current event-driven notification capabilities, outlines tracking, best practices, deliverability and personalization risks, and proposes a phased implementation and configuration plan.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Define per-email reactivation probabilities: email 1 = 0.03; email k = 0.03 * 0.7^{(k-1)} for k>=1.\nStep 2: For biweekly (2 emails): compute total monthly reactivation probability per user = p1 + p2 where p1=0.03 and p2=0.03*0.7.\nStep 3: For weekly (4 emails): compute p_total = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 with p_k defined above.\nStep 4: Multiply each total per-user probability by 5,000 to get expected reactivations.\nStep 5: Compute numeric values and compare.\nStep 6: Round results to whole users.",
