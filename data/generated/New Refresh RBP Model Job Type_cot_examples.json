  "summary": "The document explains that SAP's Role-Based Permissions (RBP) is the platform's object-centric IAM model for fine\u2011grained access control and auditability, and that the new \"Refresh RBP Model\" Admin Center job provides a one\u2011time, self\u2011service way to reconcile and propagate RBP configuration and cached permission states when the Provisioning realtime refresh is disabled. It details prerequisites (admin RBP rights, Provisioning refresh disabled), the execution workflow, security safeguards (atomic updates, rollback, single\u2011job constraint), performance limits for large environments, and operational best practices such as running during off\u2011peak times and avoiding frequent scheduling.",
