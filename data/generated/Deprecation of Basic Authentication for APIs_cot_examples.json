  "summary": "HTTP Basic Authentication is a simple HTTP-layer scheme that sends Base64-encoded username:password with each request; while easy to implement and common in internal or legacy contexts, it is insecure without HTTPS, lacks modern protections (MFA, token scopes, expiration) and is generally obsolete for public or sensitive APIs. The document compares Basic Auth to OAuth/API keys/JWTs, lists its vulnerabilities, and states the next research step will examine SAP ecosystem usage and deprecation timelines for Basic Authentication.",

Overall project duration depends on parallelization but minimal per-service disruption is about 15\u201360 minutes.\n\nThis reasoning intentionally summarizes the logical steps without internal deliberation.",
