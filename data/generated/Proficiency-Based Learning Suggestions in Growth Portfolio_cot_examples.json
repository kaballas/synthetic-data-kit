  "summary": "Proficiency-Based Learning (PBL) emphasizes demonstrated mastery rather than seat time, using proficiency scales, diverse assessments, and individualized progression; it has evolved from traditional models and is now applied in both education and corporate contexts. Effectiveness is tracked with metrics like proficiency achievement rates, change-in-proficiency, time-to-proficiency, and item-level psychometrics, and PBL integrates with talent-intelligence platforms (e.g., SAP) to map skills to roles, enable adaptive/personalized pathways, and align learning with business outcomes.",
