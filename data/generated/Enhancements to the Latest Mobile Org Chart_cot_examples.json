  "summary": "The document compiles initial and planned deep-dive findings on the Mobile Org Chart in SAP Employee Central, covering core features (navigation, display modes, exports, profile previews), matrix-management visualization, contingent-worker hiding, inactive-employee handling, and technical/UX considerations. It outlines focused search topics and a forthcoming comprehensive report that will answer specific implementation, UX, security/privacy, and optimization questions with actionable recommendations.",
