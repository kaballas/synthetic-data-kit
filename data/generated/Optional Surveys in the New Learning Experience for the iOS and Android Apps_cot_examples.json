  "summary": "Optional surveys in mobile learning (as in SAP SuccessFactors) are user-initiated feedback tools embedded in the mobile learning plan as removable cards that run natively, require full completion to submit, and integrate responses into platform reporting for L&D analysis. Best practices and considerations cover seamless cross-platform UI, brief/contextual questions to reduce fatigue, data quality and analytics methods to measure impact, and strict privacy/compliance controls (GDPR/CCPA, role-based access) to align survey use with organizational learning goals.",

      "reasoning": "Checklist of steps taken to generate this example:\n- Extract relevant facts from the report about optional vs. mandatory surveys.\n- Identify factors that influence response rate and data quality.\n- Reason about how each factor shifts metrics when surveys are optional.\n- Synthesize a balanced final assessment.\n\nStep 1: Identify report facts: optional surveys are user-initiated, can be removed/dismissed, run natively on mobile, and require full completion to submit. Mandatory surveys, by contrast, force participation (noted as a comparison point in other LMS practices).\nStep 2: List factors affecting response rate: user autonomy (reduces coercion), visibility/placement in learning plan (increases awareness), survey length/fatigue, ability to complete in one session, and perceived value.\nStep 3: Map factors to outcomes: autonomy and optional status tend to lower raw participation compared to mandatory prompts; strong placement and mobile-native UI can mitigate but not fully offset voluntary opt-out behavior; requiring full completion may discourage users who start but can\u2019t finish, reducing submit rate; shorter, relevant surveys increase both completion and data quality.\nStep 4: Consider data quality trade-offs: optional surveys favor motivated respondents, which typically improves answer honesty and reduces satisficing, increasing per-response quality; mandatory responses boost quantity but risk low-quality or rushed answers.\nStep 5: Synthesize assessment: expect lower absolute response rates for optional surveys versus mandatory ones, but higher average response quality and more reliable qualitative insights; design factors (visibility, brevity, mobile UX) can narrow the quantity gap.\n\nFinal concise assessment: Optional mobile surveys in SAP SuccessFactors will likely produce lower response rates than mandatory surveys but yield higher-quality, more honest responses; good UI placement and brief survey design can improve participation without sacrificing voluntary consent.",
