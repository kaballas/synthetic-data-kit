  "summary": "Position Budgeting Control for Cloud is an SAP integration that links SuccessFactors Employee Central with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Financials to validate budget availability, create earmarked funds, and enforce compliance before hiring or assigning positions. It delivers real-time budget tracking, approval workflows and reporting but is optimized for cloud-native SAP landscapes and may require significant customization, integration effort, and governance for multi\u2011country or legacy-system scenarios.",
