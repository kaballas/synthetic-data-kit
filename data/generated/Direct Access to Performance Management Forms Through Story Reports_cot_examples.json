  "summary": "SAP People Analytics uses SAP Analytics Cloud Story reports to visualize Performance & Goals data from SuccessFactors via live OData/direct connections; Stories are multi\u2011page, interactive presentations composed of charts, tables, and filters built on query models. Directly embedding editable Performance Management forms in Stories is limited, so SAP recommends deep links (or iframe approaches) with SSO (IAS), proper identifier-driven URL generation, and use of SuccessFactors OData/APIs and Report IDs to enable secure, context-aware navigation to forms.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify risks: URL parameter tampering leading to unauthorized access; exposure of sensitive PII in stories; session hijacking or broken SSO; links opening for users lacking permissions; unwanted caching or link-sharing.\nStep 2: Map mitigations: enforce RBAC in SuccessFactors and SAC so links only render for authorized viewers; require IAS-based SSO to prevent separate credential prompts; generate links using server-validated templates and avoid exposing raw tokens or sensitive IDs in the Story output; use HTTPS and short-lived tokens where applicable.\nStep 3: Operational controls: mask or minimize PII in Story views, enable audit logging for link usage and form access, configure Content Security Policy and disallow insecure iframe embedding, and perform periodic access reviews.\nStep 4: Testing and monitoring: validate links with test users of different roles, monitor failed/unauthorized attempts, and document incident response for data exposure.",
      "answer": "Major risks include URL tampering, PII exposure, and session issues; mitigate with RBAC and IAS SSO, server-side URL validation, minimal PII in reports, HTTPS, audit logging, and regular access reviews."

    {
      "question": "How should Story report queries and UX be optimized to scale deep-link usage across large organizations without causing performance degradation?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Limit query scope by pre-filtering data to relevant populations (role-based filters, organisational units) to reduce result set size.\nStep 2: Avoid returning heavy row-level payloads; include only identifiers needed to build deep links rather than full form data.\nStep 3: Use server-side or scheduled data models where feasible so Story widgets render quickly and link generation is simple concatenation, not runtime API calls.\nStep 4: Implement pagination or aggregated views; allow users to drill into smaller subsets before link generation.\nStep 5: Cache static mapping (e.g., form templates) and defer any expensive lookups to asynchronous background processes.\nStep 6: Test load and UX: measure Story load times, simulate concurrent users, and monitor link click latency; iterate to reduce client-side rendering complexity.\nStep 7: Provide clear in-story affordances (buttons) that open links in new tabs and handle session refresh gracefully.",
      "answer": "Optimize by returning minimal identifiers, pre-filtering and caching data, using server-side models or scheduled datasets, applying pagination/drill-down, and load-testing to ensure acceptable Story and link-click performance."
