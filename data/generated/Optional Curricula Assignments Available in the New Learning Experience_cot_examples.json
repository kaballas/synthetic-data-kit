  "summary": "The document describes SAP Learning\u2019s new Learning home page as a personalized, card-based portal that centralizes required and optional assignments\u2014surfacing optional items in an \u201cImportant Learning\u201d section with direct access, filtering, bookmark/remove actions, calendar integration, and navigation to curriculum status pages. It also summarizes how optional items are linked via curriculum metadata and Assignment Profiles, outlines role-driven visibility and reporting capabilities, and notes implementation limitations (e.g., inconsistent tagging and complex filters) with guidance to enforce clear metadata and configuration.",
