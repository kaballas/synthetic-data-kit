  "summary": "The document summarizes findings about the legacy SAP SuccessFactors People Profile Configuration OData V2 APIs, describing their architectural/functional roles, the data and settings they expose, and how they support admin and integration workflows. It also notes SAP\u2019s End of Maintenance and deletion date (May 17, 2026), the rationale for deprecation, and outlines recommended successor/migration paths plus next steps to gather authoritative migration guidance and best practices.",

      "reasoning": "- Identify critical behaviors and fields to validate\n- Map fields and business rules between old and new APIs\n- Create targeted test cases and reconciliation scripts\n- Execute sampling and full-run validations\n- Monitor and automate regression tests\n\nStep 1: Enumerate critical behaviors: direct manager links, matrix manager lists, employment records (positions, departments, status), contact details, and event reasons. Define acceptance criteria for each (e.g., manager link must resolve to a valid person ID and reflect hierarchical reporting).\nStep 2: Map legacy fields to successor API fields and note transformations (field renames, type changes, cardinality differences). Capture business-rule differences (e.g., how matrix managers are represented).\nStep 3: Design test cases: CRUD scenarios for each behavior, concurrent updates (simulate manager change + employment move), and edge cases (multiple matrix managers, missing contacts).\nStep 4: Implement automated reconciliation: compare record counts, key field values, computed relationships, and referential integrity between legacy and new API outputs; use checksums and sampling for large datasets.\nStep 5: Run integration tests with downstream systems to ensure propagated changes (provisioning, org charts) behave identically.\nStep 6: Define performance and security checks (latency under load, auth token expiry handling) to ensure non-functional parity.\nStep 7: Maintain automated regression suites and monitoring dashboards to detect drift post-cutover.",
