  "summary": "The document contrasts the legacy People Profile\u2014an older, less flexible employee data interface with basic blocks, limited customization and coarser RBP controls\u2014with the modern Full Profile, a card-based, highly configurable data hub that integrates broadly across Employee Central and talent modules and requires proper EC configuration, RBP setup, and provisioning flags. It outlines a migration workflow (audit legacy configs, export/mapping, test import, validate in a preview mode) and lists common risks such as mapping gaps, permission conflicts, unsupported custom fields, and data integrity issues. SAP-recommended practices include phased migration, thorough validation in a test/preview environment, detailed documentation and rollback plans, and engagement with SAP tools/support to resolve conflicts.",
