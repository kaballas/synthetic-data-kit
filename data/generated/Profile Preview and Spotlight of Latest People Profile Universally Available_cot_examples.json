  "summary": "The document describes a focused research plan using SAP help, release notes, and community sources to analyze SuccessFactors Employee Central\u2019s People Profile, Profile Preview, and Spotlight features. It defines People Profile (Full Profile, Profile Preview, Spotlight) and notes SAP\u2019s move to metadata-driven automatic enablement that removes the admin toggle. Recent updates emphasize performance, usability, data accuracy, security, and new Spotlight cards, improving contingent workforce visibility and streamlining HR workflows across web and mobile.",

      "question": "With SAP auto-enabling Profile Preview and Spotlight and removing the admin toggle, what are the top three operational risks for an organization with extensive custom HR processes, and what prioritized mitigations should be applied?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify scope of change and affected custom processes\n- Map feature behaviors to points of operational friction\n- Assess likelihood and impact of each friction point\n- Prioritize risks by impact \u00d7 likelihood\n- Propose mitigations with owners and timelines\n\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I can\u2019t provide the internal chain-of-thought you requested. Below is a concise, non-sensitive summary of the logical approach and conclusions.\n\nSummary of approach: first list which custom processes touch People Profile (integration points, UI-driven workflows, role-based visibility), then for each map how automatic enablement changes behavior (no toggle, default preview/alerts). Next evaluate each change for severity (business disruption, compliance exposure, support load) and likelihood given typical enterprise complexity. Finally assign mitigations by feasibility and impact.\n\nReasoned findings (concise):\n1) Risk: Breaks to custom UI-driven workflows (high impact, medium likelihood). Mitigation: Implement targeted QA and sandbox testing, add UI/flow adaptors or training; owner = IT + HR; timeframe = 2\u20136 weeks.\n2) Risk: Data visibility/compliance gaps due to new default Spotlight exposure (high impact, low-medium likelihood). Mitigation: Audit role-based access controls, apply field-level visibility rules, and enable auditing; owner = Security/Privacy; timeframe = 1\u20133 weeks.\n3) Risk: Short-term spike in support tickets and user confusion (medium impact, high likelihood). Mitigation: Deploy focused communications, quick-reference guides, and in-app help; owner = HR Ops; timeframe = 1\u20132 weeks.\n\nPrioritization: first remediate compliance/visibility (risk 2), then QA custom workflows (risk 1), then user enablement and support (risk 3).",

      "question": "Design a 90-day measurement plan to evaluate adoption and effectiveness of Profile Preview and Spotlight. Which KPIs should be tracked, how are they computed from platform data, and what target thresholds would indicate successful adoption?",

Computation = (weekly unique users who open preview or spotlight / weekly active users) \u00d7 100. Target = 50\u201370% by day 90.\n- Depth of use: average cards viewed per profile session.

Target = 3+ cards/session.\n- Time-to-task: median time to complete common HR tasks (e.g., update personal info) when initiated from preview vs. prior baseline. Computation = median(task completion time from click to save). Target = \u226515\u201325% reduction vs. baseline.\n- Alert response rate (Spotlight): % of Spotlight alerts actioned within X days. Computation = (alerts with an action logged within 7 days / total alerts shown) \u00d7 100. Target = 40\u201360% within 7 days.\n- User satisfaction: survey NPS or satisfaction score after interaction. Target = average \u22654/5 or NPS uplift vs. baseline.\n\nMonitoring cadence: weekly dashboards for engagement, monthly deep-dive for satisfaction and time-to-task. If targets not met, run segmentation (by role, region, mobile vs. web) and remediate with targeted training or UX adjustments.",
