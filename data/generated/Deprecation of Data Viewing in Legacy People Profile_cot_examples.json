  "summary": "The document summarizes research on SAP Employee Central\u2019s legacy People Profile\u2014its configurable blocks (personal, background, trends, badges), role-based permissions, and administrative options for localization, privacy, and integrations\u2014and notes how data is presented in a modular, block-based UI. It contrasts this with the new People Profile\u2019s modular, responsive, SAP Fiori\u2013aligned design offering Profile Preview/Spotlight, inline editing, and greater customization and extensibility. Finally, it notes SAP\u2019s End of Maintenance for the legacy profile on May 17, 2026, the rationale to focus innovation on the new experience, and recommended early migration to avoid security, support, and compatibility risks.",
