  "summary": "The document summarizes Employee Central quick actions in Microsoft Teams, highlighting two new actions (Global Assignment and Concurrent Employment) and added attachment support that let users manage assignment and multi\u2011employment workflows and submit documents directly from Teams. It outlines the integration architecture (Teams adaptive cards, Microsoft Graph/Teams SDK, SAP SuccessFactors OData APIs, middleware/Azure services) and security (OAuth2, RBAC, encryption), plus expected benefits for lifecycle processes and efficiency. It also notes technical, compliance, and adoption challenges (performance, attachment limits, privacy/GDPR, middleware latency) and recommends monitoring usage and adoption metrics.",
