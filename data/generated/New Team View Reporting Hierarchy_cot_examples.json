  "summary": "The document outlines a multi-step investigation to compare flat versus hierarchical team views in employee data management (especially Learning products like SAP Learning), covering architecture, data models, UI/UX, APIs/synchronization, accuracy for managers, security/compliance, integration, and optimization. The immediate focus is on researching architectural/data-model differences and SAP Learning data sources/APIs to synthesize a comprehensive report answering ten targeted questions.",

      "answer": "Use lazy loading with server-side indexed subtree queries (e.g., materialized path or indexed parent-child), render top levels first with expandable icons, cache expanded subtrees and offer on-demand full-subtree fetches; this minimizes initial latency while allowing accurate inspection of indirect reports."

      "answer": "Use event-driven CDC/webhooks into a durable message broker, transform/validate messages with versioned payloads, apply idempotent consumers that update SAP Learning via a sync API, handle failures with retries and a dead-letter queue, and maintain audit logs; this yields near-real-time, scalable sync with eventual consistency and strong observability."
