  "summary": "The document summarizes an initial investigation into the SAP Instance Refresh Tool, describing it as a full-replication utility for SuccessFactors that mirrors a source instance onto a target for realistic testing and environment consistency, and enumerates historical operational constraints (weekday-only scheduling, schema size limits, downtime during refresh, data-deletion implications, and source-target restrictions). It also notes recent updates\u2014weekend scheduling and expanded schema support to 650 GB\u2014and outlines next steps to analyze architectural impacts, performance implications, monitoring approaches, comparative tools, and best-practice guidance.",
