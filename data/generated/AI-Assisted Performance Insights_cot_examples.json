  "summary": "The document describes SAP\u2019s AI-Assisted Performance Insights as a generative-AI feature embedded in Performance & Goals forms that ingests time-bound performance inputs (continuous feedback, achievements, meeting notes, 360 reviews) and presents managers with non-persistent, on-demand summaries, strengths, achievements, improvement actions, and talking points in the manager dashboard. It also covers the underlying NLP/LLM-based generation, data preprocessing, bias mitigation and interpretability practices, and the feature\u2019s impact on managerial decision-making by surfacing trends, tailored development recommendations, and improving feedback quality while preserving role-based permissions and confidentiality.",
