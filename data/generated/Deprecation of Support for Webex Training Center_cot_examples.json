It also outlines nine focused research areas (architecture, official communications and timelines, alternative VLS vendors and migration paths, client impacts, migration guides, historical lessons, risk mitigation, an actionable transition plan, and final synthesis) and proposes further targeted searches of SAP/Cisco communications and migration resources to build a comprehensive transition plan.",

Use a conservative average of 3 hours per course \u2192 total effort = 400 courses \u00d7 3 hours = 1,200 hours.\nStep 4: Compare required effort to available hours: 1,200 required vs 360 available \u2192 shortfall = 840 hours.\nStep 5: Compute required admin headcount to meet deadline: required admins = 1,200 / 180 \u2248 6.67 \u2192 round up to 7 admins (each at 6 hours/day).\nStep 6: Determine alternatives if adding staff is infeasible: prioritize critical/compliance courses first, run parallel pilot cutover for high-impact groups, extend timeline where possible, or reduce per-course effort via automation/templates.\nStep 7: Recommend operational actions: hire/contract 5 additional admins (for total 7), or apply prioritized phased migration covering critical courses first and schedule remainder post-EOM with contingency.",
      "answer": "Not feasible with 2 admins. To finish by Nov 14 with the given work cadence, you need about 7 admins (total) or adopt a prioritized phased migration and/or automation to reduce per-course effort."
