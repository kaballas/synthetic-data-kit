  "summary": "The legacy My Forms page was a centralized interface in SAP Performance Management and 360 Reviews that organized user forms into folders (Inbox, En Route, Unfiled, custom), offered extensive filters, and supported creation, submission, and tracking within the Performance & Goals ecosystem. SAP migrated all instances to the redesigned \"Latest My Forms\" page (enabled in 2H 2023 and fully replacing the legacy page by May 16, 2025), introducing a modern UI, dynamic role-based filters, improved search and creation flows, and tighter integrations\u2014while addressing user adaptation, permission, and feature-gap challenges through documentation, patches, and support.",
