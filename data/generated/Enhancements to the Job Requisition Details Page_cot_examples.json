It also notes targeted searches and fetched SAP release notes and community resources to synthesize a comprehensive report addressing those ten points.",

      "answer": "Estimated impact: removal alone likely increases time-per-requisition by ~8\u201312% (extra 1\u20133 minutes on average). With embedded-summary, collapsible details, and role-based views, overhead should fall to ~0\u20132% (near baseline)."
