  "summary": "The document defines a ten-part investigation into SAP Learning\u2019s new home page and its optional survey feature, covering architecture, integration, data, design, privacy, impact, comparisons, technical limitations, and evidence of effectiveness.  \nInitial findings describe a personalized, skill-focused home page with targeted cards and a \u201cRequest for Me\u201d stream, and optional surveys implemented as configurable post-completion prompts (timing, targeting, opt-in) tied into analytics and UX flows.  \nSurveys collect quantitative and qualitative feedback mapped to competencies to inform content discovery and improvement, and the summary recommends brief, contextual, mobile-friendly designs with transparent data-use practices.",
