  "summary": "The document outlines a structured research plan to investigate the Workflow Request Step table in SAP Story reports, focusing on how approvers are represented, the recently added specific-approver column, and the technical/reporting implications, alongside configuration of approver assignments in SAP Employee Central and People Analytics. It will assess challenges, best practices, integrations, governance, visualization, and conclude with recommendations to optimize workflow monitoring and reporting.",
