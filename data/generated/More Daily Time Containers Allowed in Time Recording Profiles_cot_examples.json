  "summary": "The document is a concise technical and functional report on SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking, focusing on daily time containers, historical limits, and the recent 1H 2025 update that raises the per-profile container cap from 3 to 10. It explains configuration steps (creating time type groups, valuation steps, provisioning and permissions), the system's asynchronous valuation and data-synchronization methods, and the operational impacts on granularity, performance, payroll/analytics compatibility, and auditability. Recommended actions include careful configuration, performance testing, and review of integrations and payroll mappings before rollout.",
