  "summary": "The \"Rehire Inactive Employees\" feature let organizations rehire former staff by reusing the same Person ID and preserving historical records (resetting termination fields) and tied into Employee Central modules and workflows. SAP announced End of Maintenance on May 16, 2025 and deletion on May 16, 2026, and recommends migrating to the Duplicate Check feature, which offers advanced matching, flexible rehire options, and improved data integrity. A phased migration with data validation, workflow updates, training, and strong change management is advised to avoid operational disruption and maintain compliance.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Inventory current rehire behaviors \u2014 list cases where Person ID was reused vs new records created and which reports depend on single-PersonID continuity.\nStep 2: Identify Duplicate Check modes \u2014 document options to rehire as linked-to-previous-record vs create a fresh employment record and the matching criteria (e.g., National ID).\nStep 3: Define mapping rules \u2014 for each business case choose: (a) reuse historical link (keep continuity) or (b) create new employment (fresh record) and record the linking metadata (legacyPersonID or priorEmploymentID).\nStep 4: Update data model \u2014 add persistent linkage fields or audit flags to Employee Central so reports can join historical and current records reliably.\nStep 5: Adjust reports and transforms \u2014 modify reporting logic to prefer linked histories when linkage exists or to aggregate by legacyPersonID when continuity is required.\nStep 6: Test with representative rehire scenarios in a sandbox: validate PersonID handling, reporting outputs, and downstream integrations.\nStep 7: Train HR and update SOPs so users apply the correct Duplicate Check option consistently.",
      "answer": "Define explicit mapping rules: where continuity is required, use Duplicate Check\u2019s linked-rehire option and store a persistent legacyPersonID; where a fresh record is required, create a new employment and capture linkage metadata. Update reporting to join on the linkage field, test thoroughly in sandbox, and train HR before cutover."
