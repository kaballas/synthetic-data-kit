  "summary": "This report summarizes SAP Joule\u2019s March 2025 Position Management use cases, highlighting AI-driven capabilities such as dynamic \"To Be Hired\" status, automated position creation and hierarchy updates, natural-language assistant workflows, and tight integration with SuccessFactors Employee Central and SAP BTP. It also outlines expected benefits (faster position lifecycle, improved workforce planning, better succession and compliance), measured KPIs (efficiency and accuracy gains), and implementation caveats (data cleansing, legacy integration complexity, and need for phased rollout and model tuning).",

Use an assumed fully loaded HR cost of $50/hour for labor cost calculations.",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Compute monthly hours saved = 1,000 * 35% = 350 hours; annual hours saved = 350 * 12 = 4,200 hours.\nStep 2: Apply assumed HR cost: labor savings = 4,200 hours * $50/hour = $210,000 per year.\nStep 3: Vacancy-cost reduction = 25% * $200,000 = $50,000 per year.\nStep 4: Total first-year savings = labor savings + vacancy reduction = $210,000 + $50,000 = $260,000.\nNotes: assumptions (35% reduction, $50/hr) are explicit and can be adjusted if different baselines are provided.",
