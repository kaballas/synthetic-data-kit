  "summary": "The document is a structured research plan to analyze SAP\u2019s AI capabilities across Career & Talent Development, Performance & Goals, Platform, and Succession & Development, with a focus on definitions, core components, user feedback (especially free-text), methodologies for processing feedback, workflow impacts, challenges, integration/extensibility, impact metrics, and privacy/compliance. It lists targeted searches, notes that detailed SAP-centric materials have been gathered for several questions, and outlines next steps to investigate methodologies, challenges, and data\u2011privacy before synthesizing recommendations to maximize value from enhanced feedback mechanisms.",
