Mitigation: require corroborating signals (manager or peer endorsements, tracked learning/certifications) and surface confidence scores. 2) Failure mode: historical bias in training data (models perpetuate past inequities). Mitigation: run regular bias audits and retrain with balanced/augmented data plus fairness constraints. 3) Failure mode: overemphasis on passionate skills leads to poor fit for strategic roles. Mitigation: enforce multi-objective scoring with minimum thresholds for critical/core skills and configurable weight caps for passion when matching to strategic roles."
