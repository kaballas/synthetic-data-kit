Use $top to request reasonable page sizes (e.g., 500\u20132000) and follow @odata.nextLink for server-driven paging.\nStep 5: Cache repeated queries at the middleware or API gateway for short TTLs; apply exponential backoff and respect SAP rate limits.\nStep 6: Monitor query performance and add additional indexed filter predicates if scans remain expensive.\n\nExample minimal query (retrieve first page of alumni users with a small expand):\n```http\nGET /odata/v2/User?$filter=isAlumni eq true&$select=userId,isAlumni,employeeId&$expand=employeeNav($select=employeeId,jobTitle)&$top=500\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n```\n\nSummary: Verify metadata, filter early with indexed fields, minimize payload with $select, page with $top/@odata.nextLink, and cache results to reduce backend load.",
