  "summary": "The report describes SAP Employee Central time account types and balance calculation, highlighting a new option to include approved future negative bookings (e.g., planned absences) in balance computations. It summarizes configuration and calculation methods, technical and business implications (payroll accuracy, performance, integration, data integrity), typical scenarios, and the main benefits and risks of enabling this forward-looking behavior.",

      "question": "Given an employee time account with an opening balance of 120 hours, the following transactions exist: current accrual +8 hours (posted today), a manual credit +4 hours dated next month (approved), an already taken debit \u221216 hours (posted), and an approved future absence \u221224 hours scheduled next month.
