  "summary": "The document states that initial web searches yielded only partial information about two new AI settings for extracting skills in SAP AI Services Administration, so a focused search and synthesis were performed to produce an in-depth report. The report describes the settings as NLP/ML-based skill-extraction features (NER, transformer embeddings, taxonomy mapping), details technical operation and input/preprocessing recommendations, and compares them to legacy rule-based approaches, highlighting improved accuracy and scalability.",

      "question": "Which SAP AI Services Administration configuration changes would most improve precision of skill extraction while minimizing false negatives?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n- Identify configurable controls mentioned in the report\n- Summarize non-sensitive configuration actions and rationale\n- Provide concise, actionable recommendations (no internal chain-of-thought)\n\nSummary of approach: Review admin controls (confidence thresholds, taxonomy mapping, preprocessing and metadata usage, human review) and propose targeted adjustments that trade precision vs recall while limiting missed skills.",
      "answer": "Raise the extraction confidence threshold moderately, enable and customize taxonomy mapping, add preprocessing (abbreviation/term normalization) and metadata context, and enable a human-in-the-loop sampling workflow. These combined changes improve precision while limiting false negatives through controlled thresholding and targeted human validation."

      "answer": "Comparison: The new AI settings provide context-aware, scalable extraction with classification and ontology mapping, whereas rule-based methods rely on static keywords and have higher false positives/negatives. Top three mitigation strategies (prioritized): 1) Continuous taxonomy updates driven by usage logs and automated candidate terms (high impact), 2) Human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence or emerging-skill extractions to curate the taxonomy (medium impact), 3) Standardize input (abbreviation/term normalization and metadata enrichment) to improve mapping accuracy (lower but necessary impact)."
