  "summary": "The document is a 10-step plan to research and synthesize the technical definitions, history, deprecation timeline (and any withdrawal of that deprecation), alternatives, impacts, and recommendations for Tiles and Dashboard Reports in SAP People Analytics. It also summarizes that Tiles are interactive, drillable visualizations (rendered by the YouCalc engine) and Dashboards are page-level collections of Tiles, and commits to collecting official SAP communications, user impacts, comparative practices, and an actionable status/update for administrators.",

      "reasoning": "- Inventory current usage and dependencies\n- Assess feature parity and gaps between Tiles/Dashboards and Story Reports\n- Prioritize artifacts by business criticality\n- Pilot conversions, validate, then phase migration\n- Train users and maintain parallel support until cutover\nStep 1: Create an inventory of all Tiles and Dashboards, capturing owners, data sources, drill paths, and embedded links. Step 2: For each item, assess whether Story Reports can replicate required visuals, drill-to-detail, and live-data behavior; flag gaps. Step 3: Score and prioritize items by criticality (e.g., executive dashboards, operational controls). Step 4: Select a small set of high-priority dashboards and tiles to convert as a pilot; verify data fidelity and drill behavior with stakeholders. Step 5: Based on pilot learnings, define standard conversion patterns, tooling, and templates to speed remaining conversions. Step 6: Plan a phased migration schedule across the 12 months (pilot \u2192 top 50% \u2192 remainder), include buffer for fixes. Step 7: Provide targeted training for report authors and end users and run Tiles/Dashboards in parallel with converted Stories until stakeholders sign off. Step 8: Maintain rollback/continuity plans and communicate milestones to users throughout the year.",

      "question": "If SAP unexpectedly removed Tiles and Dashboard Reports, what are the primary technical risks and a prioritized mitigation plan to minimize analytics downtime and business impact?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify immediate technical risks from removal\n- Prioritize mitigations by impact and implementation speed\n- Implement short-term workarounds then medium-term conversions\n- Communicate with stakeholders and escalate to SAP support\nStep 1: Identify risks: broken embedded links, loss of live drill-to-detail, interrupted scheduled displays (home page tiles), and loss of visualizations relied on by execs/operations. Step 2: Assess impact: determine which reports are mission-critical and which are informational. Step 3: Rapid mitigations: export tile/dashboard definitions and underlying queries; capture screenshots and data extracts for immediate access; enable scheduled exports where possible. Step 4: Implement temporary replacements: recreate high-priority visuals as simple Table/Canvas or Story Report equivalents focusing on data accuracy over exact UI parity. Step 5: Stabilize data sources: ensure underlying ad hoc/reporting datasets remain accessible and grant alternate access to analysts. Step 6: Engage SAP support and participate in community channels to obtain migration tooling or patches. Step 7: Communicate timeline and interim workarounds to users and set expectations for full restoration via Story Reports conversions.",
      "answer": "Top risks: broken drill-to-detail, lost live tiles on home pages, and broken embedded links. Prioritized mitigation: 1) Immediately export definitions and underlying data; 2) Recreate mission-critical visuals in Story/Table/Canvas as temporary replacements; 3) Provide scheduled data extracts/screenshots for execs; 4) Engage SAP support for migration tooling; 5) Communicate status and timelines to stakeholders."

      "reasoning": "- Count items and apply per-item conversion estimates\n- Sum base conversion effort\n- Apply testing and coordination overhead percentages\n- Produce final person-day estimate with assumptions noted\nStep 1: Base conversion effort: 25 Tiles \u00d7 2.5 pd = 62.5 person-days; 8 Dashboards \u00d7 5 pd = 40 person-days.
