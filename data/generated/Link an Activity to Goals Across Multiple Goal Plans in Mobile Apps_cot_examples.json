  "summary": "The document describes SAP SuccessFactors\u2019 Performance & Goals module as a continuous performance management framework where goal plans group performance and development goals and activities serve as evidence of progress. It notes that mobile apps historically supported one-to-one activity-to-goal linking but a recent update allows a single activity to be linked to multiple goals across plans (up to 20 performance and 20 development goals), requiring UI and synchronization changes and improving UX, reporting, and alignment. Next steps call for deeper research into use cases, APIs, configurations, security, workflows, adoption feedback, and enterprise integration to complete a detailed report.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify current reporting assumptions that expect a one-to-one activity\u2192goal mapping and enumerate reports that aggregate activities by goal.\nStep 2: Determine how multiple links change counting semantics (e.g., risk of double-counting the same activity across goals) and decide an attribution model (full count, fractional weighting, or ownership-based attribution).\nStep 3: Update report definitions and ETL/aggregation logic to implement the chosen attribution model and add filters for goal type (performance vs development) and plan scope.\nStep 4: Enforce permission and visibility rules so only authorized links contribute to sensitive reports, and ensure legacy goal plans are handled consistently.\nStep 5: Add audit trails, validation rules, and monitoring to detect and correct inconsistent or excessive link patterns.\nStep 6: Roll out changes with stakeholder communication and sample report validation to confirm metrics reflect intended behaviors.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Enforce client-side validation of selections against platform limits (max 20 performance and 20 development goals) to prevent invalid requests.\nStep 2: Use optimistic UI updates and local caching so the app remains responsive while background sync occurs.\nStep 3: Batch user changes into a single atomic update payload referencing all selected goal IDs and send as one transaction to the backend to reduce partial-write states.\nStep 4: Implement server-side transactional writes and deterministic conflict resolution (e.g., merge rules, last-writer-with-timestamp, or require explicit user merge for concurrent edits).\nStep 5: Provide clear sync status and retry logic in the UI, surface errors that require user action, and record audit logs for reconciliation.\nStep 6: Monitor sync metrics and adjust debounce/batching windows to balance latency and collision risk.",
      "answer": "Validate limits client-side, use optimistic UI with local caching, send batched atomic updates of all goal IDs, rely on server-side transactions with deterministic conflict resolution and retries, and surface sync status and audit logs to maintain consistency and responsiveness."
