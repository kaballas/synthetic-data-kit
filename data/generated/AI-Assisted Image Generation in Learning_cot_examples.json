  "summary": "The document surveys the current state of AI-assisted image generation for education\u2014covering leading models and platforms (diffusion models, transformer-based generators, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, OpenAI, Adobe Firefly, etc.), core capabilities for producing instructional visuals, and common pedagogical use cases and best practices. It details SAP Learning Administration\u2019s AI image features, integration architecture, customization and moderation controls, evaluation methods for learning effectiveness, and highlights limitations, ethical/copyright/accessibility risks. Finally, it outlines a structured 10-step research and implementation plan to compare SAP with other LMS tools and produce actionable deployment guidance.",
