  "summary": "The document is a comprehensive analysis of proficiency-level naming and descriptions in talent intelligence platforms\u2014with emphasis on SAP Talent Intelligence Hub\u2014covering global standards, level structures, design/update methodologies, UX/psychology, governance, and common pitfalls. It recommends clear, behavior-based level names with numeric and multilingual support, pilot testing, stakeholder governance, immutable internal identifiers, and versioning to protect reporting, interoperability, and user adoption.",

      "question": "An international company currently uses a 5\u2011level proficiency scale in SAP Talent Intelligence Hub and wants to rename levels and update descriptions across four locales without breaking historical reports or integrations. What sequence of actions should they take, what risks must they mitigate, and what mapping/versioning strategy will ensure continuity of historic data?",
      "reasoning": "Checklist:\n- Identify constraints and stakeholders.\n- Prepare a sandbox and a versioned change plan.\n- Implement display-only changes while preserving stable identifiers.\n- Test integrations, reporting, and translations.\n- Deploy with communication, monitoring, and rollback plans.\n\nHigh-level stepwise approach (summary):\nStep 1: Inventory and governance \u2014 Catalog the exact scale(s) in use, which attribute types are associated, which integrations and reports reference level names or numeric values, and assemble HR, IT, analytics, and localization owners.\nStep 2: Preserve stable identifiers \u2014 Ensure the platform\u2019s internal, non\u2011changing IDs (or create them if missing) will remain the canonical reference for reporting; plan to change only display names/descriptions tied to those IDs.\nStep 3: Sandbox & draft changes \u2014 In a sandbox, update display names and localized descriptions for the existing levels; do not alter numeric scale boundaries or internal IDs associated with attributes if those are locked in production.\nStep 4: Compatibility mapping \u2014 Create a mapping table that explicitly pairs old display names and numeric values to new display names per locale; surface this mapping to ETL, analytics, and integration owners so dashboards can reference stable IDs or map names consistently.\nStep 5: Integration and report testing \u2014 Run end\u2011to\u2011end tests for exports, HRIS/LMS mappings, reports, and dashboards; validate that queries use IDs or the mapping layer so historic trends remain intact.\nStep 6: Pilot and localization QA \u2014 Pilot with a representative business unit in all four locales, verify translations and UX, and collect feedback on clarity and adoption.\nStep 7: Production rollout, communication, monitoring \u2014 Deploy changes, publish change logs and training, monitor analytics for unexpected shifts, and keep a short\u2011term audit view that shows pre/post display names for traceability.\nStep 8: Rollback & archival \u2014 If critical issues appear, revert display names in the sandbox first and then in production; keep archived versions of previous names and descriptions linked to timestamps for audits.\n\nKey risks and mitigations (summary):\n- Risk: Reports or integrations reference display names (breaking analytics). Mitigation: Force integrations to use internal IDs or introduce a mapping layer in the ETL/reporting pipeline before changing display names.\n- Risk: Translation inconsistencies. Mitigation: Localize and QA all locales in sandbox and include native reviewers.\n- Risk: User confusion. Mitigation: Communicate changes, show numeric values alongside names, and provide examples/behavioral descriptions.\n\nFinal mapping/versioning principle: Never change the immutable internal identifier or the numeric semantics used by analytics; change only display names/descriptions and maintain a versioned mapping table that ties historical data to the new labels for reporting continuity.",
      "answer": "Create a governed plan: preserve internal IDs, update display names/descriptions in sandbox per locale, build a versioned mapping layer for ETL/reporting, test integrations and reports end\u2011to\u2011end, pilot, then deploy with communication and rollback procedures. Do not change immutable identifiers or numeric semantics; use mapping/versioning to preserve historic analytics."

      "question": "SAP Talent Intelligence Hub prevents changing the number of proficiency levels after a scale is associated with attribute types. How can a large organization migrate from a 3\u2011level scale to a 5\u2011level scale while preserving historical assessments and minimizing disruption?",
      "reasoning": "Checklist:\n- Audit current usage and associations.\n- Create a parallel new scale instead of altering the existing one.\n- Define explicit mappings from old to new levels and preserve historical records.\n- Pilot conversion and adapt reporting to support dual scales.\n- Deploy with fallback and archival strategies.\n\nStepwise high\u2011level plan (summary):\nStep 1: Audit & stakeholder alignment \u2014 List all attributes, roles, reports, integrations, and processes that use the 3\u2011level scale; agree on business rationale and timeline with HR, analytics, and IT.\nStep 2: Create a new 5\u2011level scale \u2014 In SAP Admin Center, create a separate scale (do not attempt to change the existing 3\u2011level scale), provide names/descriptions and localized variants, and assign it to new or targeted attribute types.\nStep 3: Mapping strategy for historic data \u2014 Define a deterministic mapping from 3 levels to 5 levels for reporting (for example: 3\u21921 maps to 1, 3\u21922 maps to 3, 3\u21923 maps to 5 or use midpoint mapping depending on business rules). Store this mapping in the data warehouse or reporting layer rather than rewriting raw assessment records.\nStep 4: Phased adoption \u2014 Start assigning the new 5\u2011level scale to new hires/attributes or specific business units; run parallel usage for a transition period so users see both old and new scales where relevant.\nStep 5: Data handling & reporting \u2014 For historical trend analysis, implement a reporting transformation that normalizes old 3\u2011level data into the 5\u2011level schema using the agreed mapping; keep source data immutable for audits.\nStep 6: Pilot & adjust \u2014 Pilot conversion logic and dashboards with a representative dataset, refine mappings based on stakeholder feedback, and validate downstream systems (HRIS, LMS, compensation tools).\nStep 7: Communication & training \u2014 Explain how historic scores are mapped, update documentation, and train managers on interpreting the new 5\u2011level scale alongside legacy results.\nStep 8: Finalization & archival \u2014 After stabilization, phase out the 3\u2011level scale in active use but archive it (with metadata and timestamps) so audits and rollback remain possible.\n\nRollback and audit considerations (summary):\n- Never overwrite raw historic assessment records; apply mapping in reporting layers so rollback is trivial.\n- Archive the old scale definition and keep change logs and approvals for compliance.\n- Retain sandbox backups and test restore procedures before wide rollout.",
      "answer": "Do not change the existing 3\u2011level scale. Create a new 5\u2011level scale, define and store an explicit mapping from old to new levels in the reporting/ETL layer, run a phased pilot with parallel usage, validate integrations and reports, communicate changes, and archive the old scale. Preserve raw historical records and implement mapping in analytics so historic trends remain auditable and reversible."
