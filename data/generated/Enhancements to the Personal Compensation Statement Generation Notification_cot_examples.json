  "summary": "The document summarizes comprehensive research on PCS (Personal Compensation Statement) notification emails, covering key components and design best practices (HTML formatting, branding, headers/footers, clear subject/preheader, accessibility), the influence of diverse compensation-plan templates on email structure, and technical and compliance considerations (deliverability, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, data privacy, plain-text fallback). It also reviews platform-specific constraints (e.g., SAP Compensation), global/localization and legal issues, template management and dynamic content strategies, and recommends responsive/templates-per-plan design, rigorous testing, analytics, and governance for secure, compliant, and effective PCS communications.",

There are 6 compensation plans with availability: Plans A/B/C = all 12 countries; Plan D = EU only (6 countries); Plan E = 4 non-EU countries; Plan F = 2 EU countries (the ones using German and French). If each email template must be localized by language and must use different legal disclaimers for EU vs non-EU, what is the minimum number of distinct email template variants required to cover all plans, languages, and legal variants (count only variants that apply to at least one country)?",

Map languages to EU/non-EU presence: English exists in both EU and non-EU (so English-EU and English-nonEU both needed). French and German exist only in EU (so only French-EU and German-EU needed).\n2. For each plan, list which countries (and thus which language/region combinations) the plan covers, then derive which language/region combinations appear at least once for that plan.\n3.

Sum across all plans.\n\nCalculations (concise):\n- Global plans A/B/C (all 12 countries): languages present across those countries are English (both EU and non-EU), French (EU), German (EU). Required variants per global plan = English-EU + English-nonEU + French-EU + German-EU = 4 variants each.
