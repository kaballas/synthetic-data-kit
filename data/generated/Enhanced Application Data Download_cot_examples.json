  "summary": "The document synthesizes findings about SAP Recruiting\u2019s Enhanced Application Data Download, describing its capabilities (bulk PDF/ZIP downloads for up to ~50 applicants/100 documents, background zipping with email notification, 24\u2011hour availability) and how it fits into recruiter workflows. It also summarizes stored data types, security and GDPR controls (role\u2011based access, encryption, audit logging), practical limits (no concurrent requests, size/compatibility constraints), and recommended practices for planning and troubleshooting.",

      "question": "Given 120 applicants where each applicant has a resume and cover letter; additionally 40 of these applicants have 2 extra attachments each (so those 40 have 4 documents total). The Enhanced Application Data Download limits are max 50 applicants and max 100 documents per download request. What is the minimum number of download requests required to retrieve all documents for all 120 applicants?",
      "reasoning": "Checklist of steps I will apply to construct each example:\n- Identify constraints and per-applicant document counts.\n- Compute total documents and categorize applicants by document count.\n- Determine optimal batching strategy respecting both applicant and document caps.\n- Count batches and report the minimum number.\n\nStep 1: Identify applicant groups and their document counts: 80 applicants have 2 documents each (resume + cover), and 40 applicants have 4 documents each (resume + cover + 2 attachments).\nStep 2: Compute totals: 80 * 2 = 160 documents from the 2-doc group; 40 * 4 = 160 documents from the 4-doc group; total = 320 documents.\nStep 3: Apply per-request limits (<=50 applicants and <=100 documents). To minimize requests, pack up to 100 documents per request while not exceeding 50 applicants.\n- Batch 1: choose 50 of the 2-doc applicants \u2192 50 * 2 = 100 documents.\n- Remaining after Batch 1: 30 two-doc applicants and 40 four-doc applicants.\n- Batch 2: include all 30 remaining two-doc applicants (60 docs) + 10 four-doc applicants (10 * 4 = 40) \u2192 60 + 40 = 100 documents (40 applicants this batch).\n- Remaining after Batch 2: 30 four-doc applicants (30 * 4 = 120 documents).\n- Batch 3: take 25 of those four-doc applicants \u2192 25 * 4 = 100 documents.\n- Batch 4: remaining 5 four-doc applicants \u2192 5 * 4 = 20 documents.\nStep 4: Count batches: 4 requests are required and they respect both caps in every batch.\n\nThis reasoning is a concise, stepwise allocation summary rather than internal deliberation.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Determine number of batches required: max 50 applicants per request \u2192 ceil(300 / 50) = 6 batches.\nStep 2: For each batch, account for sequential actions that cannot overlap: preparation time (10 minutes) plus the recruiter's download/save time (5 minutes) before starting the next request.\nStep 3: Compute time per batch: 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.\nStep 4: Multiply by number of batches: 6 * 15 = 90 minutes.\nStep 5: Convert to hours if desired: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours.\n\nThis is a concise procedural calculation (constraints \u2192 batches \u2192 per-batch time \u2192 total) rather than internal chain-of-thought.",
