  "summary": "The document summarizes initial research and a comprehensive report on the reverse proxy feature in SAP Provisioning, covering its IAM role as a gateway, core functions, technical specs (e.g., SCIM 2.0, OAuth, certificate-based auth), integration points, dependencies, and deprecation/migration considerations. It also documents planned targeted searches for official SAP deprecation notices, recommended alternatives, migration strategies, industry best practices, and case studies to produce a detailed, practical migration report.",

      "question": "Given SAP's deletion date for the reverse proxy feature on November 21, 2025, what is the latest calendar date to start a 6\u2011month phased migration so it completes before deletion? What practical buffer should teams add given the end-of-support date of June 2, 2025?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify the fixed deadline (deletion date).\n- Subtract the planned rollout duration to compute the theoretical latest start.\n- Consider operational constraints and the earlier end-of-support date to recommend a practical buffer.\n\nSummary of approach: I use the deletion date (Nov 21, 2025) as the hard completion deadline and subtract a 6\u2011month (\u2248183 days) rollout to find the theoretical latest start. Because end-of-support (June 2, 2025) precedes the deletion date, I recommend an earlier practical start to avoid operating in an unsupported window and to allow time for testing, fallbacks, and unexpected delays.",
      "answer": "The theoretical latest start is about May 21, 2025 (six months before Nov 21, 2025). Practically, start earlier \u2014 e.g., by mid-March 2025 \u2014 to complete migration before the June 2, 2025 end-of-support and to allow adequate testing and contingency time."

      "question": "An organization has 12 downstream systems to migrate. Each system takes ~2 weeks to migrate; up to 4 migrations can run in parallel. Including a 4\u2011week project testing and stabilization buffer, what is the minimum calendar duration to finish migration, and what is the latest start date to meet the Nov 21, 2025 deletion deadline?",
      "reasoning": "- Compute how many parallel batches are required given concurrency limits.\n- Multiply batches by per-system duration to obtain core execution time.\n- Add the testing/stabilization buffer and subtract from the deletion deadline to find the latest start.\n\nSummary of approach: With 4 concurrent migrations, systems are grouped into batches (ceil(12/4)=3). Each batch takes ~2 weeks, so core work is 3\u00d72=6 weeks. Adding the 4\u2011week testing/stabilization buffer yields a total of ~10 weeks. Subtracting 10 weeks from Nov 21, 2025 gives the latest practical start date.",
      "answer": "Core execution time: 6 weeks. With a 4\u2011week buffer: 10 weeks total. Latest start to meet Nov 21, 2025 is approximately September 12, 2025 (about 10 weeks before Nov 21, 2025)."

      "question": "For organizations needing secure hybrid connectivity, minimal backend code changes, and continued SAP support after reverse proxy deletion, which migration alternative is the most suitable and why?",
      "reasoning": "- List candidate alternatives (native OAuth direct connectivity, SAP Cloud Connector, SAP Cloud Identity Services / IAS, third\u2011party API gateways).\n- Evaluate each against the criteria: secure hybrid connectivity, minimal backend changes, and SAP support continuity.\n- Select the option that best balances those criteria and summarize why.\n\nSummary of approach: Compare recommended SAP alternatives and third\u2011party options on security posture, integration effort, and vendor support. Prioritize solutions that preserve hybrid connectivity without extensive backend rewrites and remain within SAP's supported ecosystem.",
      "answer": "Recommendation: Use SAP Cloud Connector combined with native SCIM/OAuth endpoints and SAP Cloud Identity Services (IAS) for authentication. This approach provides secure hybrid connectivity with minimal backend code changes and aligns with SAP support and roadmap, while enabling robust security and scalable cloud integration."
