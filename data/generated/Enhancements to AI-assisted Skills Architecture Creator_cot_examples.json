  "summary": "The document summarizes the AI-assisted skills architecture creator in SAP Talent Intelligence Hub, outlining its components (Job Profile Builder, Recruiting, Upgrade Center, Scheduled Job Manager, Attributes Library), how skills are inferred from recent job profiles/requisitions, and the incremental extraction enhancement that processes only newly created or modified items into the Attributes Library for downstream use. It notes governance, normalization, privacy and bias-mitigation concerns, and recommends targeted searches and document fetches (technical architecture, algorithms, incremental criteria, performance, security, and workflows) to produce a comprehensive research report.",

      "answer": "About 30 records would likely be missed; mitigate by periodic full runs, version/change logs or event-driven updates, validation alerts, and reconciliation reports."
