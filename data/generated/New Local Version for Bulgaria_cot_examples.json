It then details a targeted investigation and extracted Bulgarian-localization data elements\u2014personal identifiers (EGN, DOB, nationality, marital status), addresses (permanent/temporary), social/health identifiers and disability/union codes, contract elements (type, schedule, salary components, leave/probation) and dependents\u2014along with planned compliance, comparison, and implementation analyses.",
