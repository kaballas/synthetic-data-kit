  "summary": "Continuous Feedback evolved in early 2024 from episodic, manager-driven notes to a real-time, multi-source model that captures structured ratings, contextual metadata, and automated analytics to support continuous performance tuning. The report synthesizes data types (text, scores, roles, timestamps, sentiment), Enhanced Table Report capabilities (filtering, visualization, aggregation, integrations), and methodologies for data compilation, while highlighting organizational complexity, versioning challenges, limitations, and optimization recommendations for enterprise deployment.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Choose a common target scale (e.g., 0\u2013100) to express all ratings uniformly.\nStep 2: Apply a linear mapping for legacy ratings: use $normalized=\\frac{(rating-1)}{4}\\times100$ to convert 1\u20135 into 0\u2013100.\nStep 3: For post-2024 ratings already on 0\u2013100, validate consistency and clamp outliers.\nStep 4: Handle missing data: if missing is <5% consider exclusion; for larger gaps apply imputation (department median or model-based) and flag imputed values.\nStep 5: Compute department-level averages using sample-size weighting: $dept\\_avg=\\frac{\\sum_{i} normalized_i}{n_{dept}}$, but apply empirical Bayes shrinkage when $n_{dept}$ is small to reduce variance.\nStep 6: Produce final organization-wide metric as a weighted mean of department averages weighted by department sample counts or by employee headcount depending on stakeholder preference.\nStep 7: Validate by comparing pre/post-normalization distributions and running sensitivity checks (with/without imputed data and with/without shrinkage).",

      "question": "Given mixed-source feedback (manager, peer, self) with differing mean sentiment and sample sizes across groups, how do you detect and adjust for rater bias so aggregated sentiment in the Table Report reflects fairer comparisons across teams?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Segment feedback by rater type and compute descriptive statistics (count, mean, variance) per rater group and per team.\nStep 2: Test for systematic differences: use t-tests or ANOVA for continuous sentiment scores and compute effect sizes to establish whether manager means differ significantly from peer/self means.\nStep 3: Quantify bias per rater-type by estimating calibration offsets (e.g., $offset_{type}=mean_{type}-mean_{overall}$) and variability.\nStep 4: Adjust scores using one of two defensible approaches: (A) subtract the calibration offset per rater type (additive normalization) or (B) z-score normalize by rater-type then rescale to a common mean/SD; prefer empirical Bayes shrinkage when counts are small.\nStep 5: Recompute aggregated team sentiment using sample-size weighting after adjustment and report both raw and adjusted metrics with confidence intervals.\nStep 6: Validate adjustments by checking that adjusted rankings are stable under bootstrap resampling and that known-good benchmarks (e.g., calibration groups) align post-adjustment.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Introduce a pre-aggregation layer: maintain daily or weekly materialized aggregates (counts, sums, averages) keyed by common slice dimensions (date, department, rater type, competency).\nStep 2: Use indexing and partitioning on heavy filter columns (date, org_unit, rater_type) and enable partition pruning to limit scanned data.\nStep 3: Employ an OLAP or columnar analytical store to accelerate ad-hoc aggregations and enable vectorized queries.\nStep 4: Implement caching of recent queries and saved report templates; return cached aggregates for repeated filters.\nStep 5: Limit client-side work by paging large result sets and using server-side computed sparklines/minicharts.\nStep 6: Provide query complexity controls: warn on extremely nested filters, offer query previews, and allow asynchronous report runs for very broad queries.\nStep 7: Monitor performance metrics and iterate (add indices, tune materialized view refresh cadence) and add adaptive throttling for heavy concurrent usage.",
      "answer": "Apply materialized pre-aggregations, partition and index by common filters, move analytical workloads to columnar/OLAP stores, cache frequent queries, enforce paging and server-side rendering for visuals, provide async runs for heavy queries, and monitor/tune iteratively to restore interactive performance while preserving drill-down capability."
