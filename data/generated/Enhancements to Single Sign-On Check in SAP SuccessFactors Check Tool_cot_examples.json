  "summary": "SAP SuccessFactors is a cloud HCM platform that uses an IAM framework centered on SAML 2.0-based SSO, with SuccessFactors acting as the Service Provider and SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS) or corporate IdPs handling authentication; configurations include SAML certificates, ACS URLs, NameID/attribute mappings, and support for hybrid/conditional authentication and OAuth/OIDC via SAP Cloud Identity Services. The SAP Check Tool validates SSO setups by analyzing SAML metadata, assertions, certificates, endpoints, and logs, detecting common misconfigurations (expired certs, wrong ACS URLs, signature failures) and now offers enhanced diagnostics, real-time certificate warnings, delegated authentication checks, ML-assisted anomaly detection, and prioritized/exportable reports. Overall the document outlines best-practice checks, detection methodologies, and recommendations for improving SSO reliability, security, and operational visibility.",
