  "summary": "The document is a detailed investigation into migrating ESS Time Off and Time Sheet UI permissions from the legacy Employee Views category to the dedicated Time Management User Permissions category in SAP Employee Central, covering definitions, history, migration specifics, security/compliance, technical procedures, risks, best practices, and end-user impacts. It concludes that permissions like \"Access Time Off\" and \"Access Time Sheet\" have been centralized and made more granular under Time Management User Permissions, improving security, governance, and administrative clarity. The migration generally automates during updates but requires role redesign, testing, and mitigation of configuration/audit risks to avoid disruption.",
