      "question": "You must send 10,000 personalized employment contracts from SAP Employee Central via the DocuSign API. The integration is subject to a hard API throttle of 500 envelope-send calls per minute. What is the minimum theoretical dispatch time without throttling violations, what practical schedule should you implement to allow retries and system stability, and what batch sizes/timing minimize total completion time?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - Identify the API limit and total envelope count.\n  - Compute theoretical minimum time under continuous usage.\n  - Apply a practical reserve for retries and monitoring.\n  - Convert rates into batch sizes and intervals to implement.\n\nStep 1: Compute theoretical minimum time. With 10,000 envelopes and 500 calls/minute, minimum continuous minutes = 10,000 / 500 = 20 minutes.\nStep 2: Reserve capacity for retries and spikes. Allocate a 10% capacity reserve for retries/callbacks (usable rate = 500 * 0.9 = 450 envelopes/minute).\nStep 3: Recompute practical time with reserve. Practical minutes = ceil(10,000 / 450) = ceil(22.222...) = 23 minutes.\nStep 4: Choose batch sizes and intervals to avoid short-burst throttling. Examples:\n  - Micro-batches: 50 envelopes every (60 * 50 / 45000) \u2248 every 6.67 seconds produces steady throughput (50 * 9 batches/min = 450/min).\n  - Mid-sized batches: 150 envelopes every 20 seconds (3 batches/min * 150 = 450/min).\nStep 5: Implement exponential backoff for retries and reserve ~10% of each minute for retry attempts and callback processing.\nStep 6: Monitor live rate and errors; if error rate is low, consider reducing reserve incrementally.\n\nSummary of operational recommendations: run 450 sends/minute to preserve retries, completing in ~23 minutes; use micro- or mid-sized batches (e.g., 50 every ~6.7s or 150 every 20s); implement retry/backoff and real-time monitoring to adjust throttle usage.",

      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - Segment documents/recipients by jurisdiction.\n  - Map required signature type and authentication per segment.\n  - Configure template and workflow conditional logic.\n  - Ensure storage, audit trail, and data residency meet each jurisdiction.\n\nStep 1: Segment at generation time. Use employee country/region data in SAP EC to tag each generated document with jurisdiction (EU vs US).\nStep 2: Map signature type per jurisdiction. For EU-tagged documents, request eIDAS-qualified signatures via DocuSign\u2019s qualified service (or integrate with a QES provider). For US-tagged documents, use standard DocuSign eSignature with ESIGN/UETA-compliant audit trail.\nStep 3: Configure recipient authentication. EU/QES flows require strong signer authentication (e.g., eID or DocuSign ID verification); US flows can use email + optional 2FA or access code depending on risk.\nStep 4: Implement conditional template logic. Create templates with conditional fields/tags and route envelopes to the DocuSign endpoint and signing profile corresponding to the required signature level.\nStep 5: Ensure audit and evidence capture. Enable full DocuSign audit trails, signer identity proofs, timestamps, and certificate records for both flows; store proof metadata alongside the signed document.\nStep 6: Data residency and storage. Route final signed documents to storage locations compliant with local data residency rules (EU docs stored in EU region if required); apply role-based access controls and retention policies per jurisdiction.\nStep 7: Test and document. Run pilots per country, validate legal acceptance with local counsel, and maintain configuration templates for repeatable mass runs.\n\nConcise compliance plan: branch by jurisdiction at generation, apply QES for EU and standard eSignature for US, enforce appropriate authentication, collect full audit evidence, and store documents with jurisdictional data-residency and retention controls.",
