  "summary": "The document describes SAP Employee Central\u2019s \"View leave balance\" as a real-time, time-type\u2013aware self-service feature tightly integrated with Time Management and Employee Central to present accruals, adjustments, planned absences, and payroll-relevant balances for employees, managers, and HR. The September 2025 update adds time-type views, balance calculations that consider future negative bookings, and SAP Business AI\u2013driven predictions and personalized recommendations, improving accuracy and planning and distinguishing SAP from many HR platforms that use batch updates or limited AI.",

      "question": "Given an employee with an accrual rate of 1.5 days/month starting January 1, 2025, who has used 4 days so far and has a retroactive manual reduction of 2 days, and who has a future booked absence of 5 days in October 2025, what is the current leave balance as of September 30, 2025 when the system setting \"Consider bookings after calculation date\" is enabled?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps to generate this example:\n  - Identify input parameters (accrual rate, period, used days, manual adjustments, future bookings).\n  - Compute accrued entitlement to date.\n  - Apply subtractions (used days, manual adjustments, future bookings if the setting is enabled).\n  - Present the resulting balance.\n\nStep 1: Identify inputs \u2014 accrual 1.5 days/month from Jan 1 to Sep 30 (9 months), used = 4 days, manual adjustment = -2 days, future booked = 5 days.\nStep 2: Compute accrued entitlement = 1.5 \u00d7 9 = 13.5 days.\nStep 3: Apply deductions in order: subtract used days (13.5 \u2212 4 = 9.5), subtract manual adjustment (9.5 \u2212 2 = 7.5), subtract future booked absences because the setting is enabled (7.5 \u2212 5 = 2.5).\nStep 4: Report the final balance as the computed result.",
