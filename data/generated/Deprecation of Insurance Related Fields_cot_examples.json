  "summary": "The insurance-related fields formerly embedded in the Benefit object were deprecated (End of Development: 2023-06-02) and migrated into new, dedicated objects such as InsuranceBenefitDetails (deletion planned for 2026-05-15) to improve performance and maintainability. Key fields (e.g., insuranceType, nomineeRelevant, insurancePlans, coverage \u2192 defaultCoverage, plan \u2192 defaultPlan, enrolleeOptions \u2192 defaultEnrolleeOptions) now live in the new object, requiring updates to APIs, Story reports, business rules, and integrations; migration guidance, impact analysis, and testing strategies are being gathered to support the transition.",
