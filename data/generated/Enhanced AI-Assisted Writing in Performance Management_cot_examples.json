      "question": "For SAP SuccessFactors' 'Generate Comments' feature using LLMs, what specific data inputs, processing stages, and privacy safeguards must be combined to produce role- and competency-specific comments while meeting GDPR requirements?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify required inputs\n- Define processing pipeline stages\n- Enumerate privacy and compliance safeguards\n- Specify validation and human-in-the-loop controls\nStep 1: Identify inputs \u2014 list structured sources the model should consume (role, competency framework, ratings, goal progress, timestamped achievements, anonymized examples) and optional free-text context from the reviewer.\nStep 2: Define preprocessing \u2014 normalize fields, map role to competency taxonomy, redact or pseudonymize direct identifiers, and create embeddings or prompt templates that encode competency alignment.\nStep 3: Model generation \u2014 use a fine-tuned LLM or controlled prompt on a hosted service (e.g., Azure OpenAI) to generate candidate comments constrained by tone and length rules; apply decoding controls to reduce hallucination.\nStep 4: Post-processing and safety \u2014 run automated checks for sensitive data leakage, biased phrasing, and policy violations; enforce templates that include specific examples or recommended next steps where available.\nStep 5: Privacy safeguards \u2014 implement data minimization (only send needed fields), pseudonymization/anonymization, encryption in transit and at rest, tenant isolation, access controls, consent and purpose declarations, and retention policies aligned to GDPR.\nStep 6: Human-in-the-loop and audit \u2014 present AI output as an editable draft clearly labeled as AI-generated, require reviewer edits or approval, log all generation events for auditability and periodic bias/accuracy reviews.\nStep 7: Continuous improvement \u2014 capture acceptance/revision rates and feedback to retrain or adjust prompts while using aggregated/anonymized data and documented governance to preserve compliance.",
      "answer": "Combine structured inputs (role, ratings, competencies, achievements) with preprocessing (redaction, taxonomy mapping), constrained LLM generation, automated safety checks, and strict GDPR-aligned safeguards (minimization, pseudonymization, encryption, access controls), present outputs as editable AI-labeled drafts, and maintain audit logs and human review."

      "answer": "Define clear objectives, pick mixed KPIs (volume, time-to-submit, quality scores, AI acceptance/revision rates, engagement), gather baselines, instrument logging and surveys, run phased rollouts/A-B tests, set quarterly targets, and govern with monthly reviews and audits."

      "question": "What deployment and governance controls should a company implement to ensure SAP's AI-assisted feedback tools augment managers' judgement without causing over-reliance or reducing feedback authenticity?",
      "reasoning": "- Plan phased deployment and pilot controls\n- Configure UI and policy rules to preserve human oversight\n- Implement monitoring, training, and audit mechanisms\nStep 1: Phased rollout \u2014 start with a controlled pilot (selected teams) to validate outputs, gather qualitative feedback, and tune prompts and templates.\nStep 2: UI safeguards \u2014 always surface AI text as a labeled, editable draft; disable auto-accept; require explicit reviewer confirmation and encourage personalization by defaulting to a short editable prompt with suggested placeholders for examples.\nStep 3: Policy and role rules \u2014 set policies that mandate human review for performance-critical statements, restrict AI use for disciplinary contexts, and require senior approval for high-impact outcomes.\nStep 4: Training and change management \u2014 train managers on interpreting AI suggestions, editing for authenticity and developmental intent, and recognizing AI limitations; provide examples of good edits.\nStep 5: Monitoring and metrics \u2014 track acceptance vs edit rates, personalization score (presence of specific examples), frequency of AI use by role, and downstream employee sentiment to detect over-reliance or genericization.\nStep 6: Auditing and bias checks \u2014 schedule periodic audits of AI outputs for bias, repetitiveness, and cultural fit; remediate by updating training data or prompts and tightening safeguards.\nStep 7: Continuous governance loop \u2014 incorporate user feedback into model governance, maintain transparency with employees about AI role, and enforce retention and access controls to protect data.",
      "answer": "Use a phased pilot, require labeled editable AI drafts with explicit human approval, enforce policies for sensitive contexts, provide manager training, monitor acceptance/edit/personalization metrics, run periodic audits for bias/authenticity, and iterate governance based on measured outcomes."
