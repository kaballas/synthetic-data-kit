  "summary": "The Outlook add-in let users submit continuous feedback from the Outlook desktop client into SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals via an Exchange-deployed manifest, but had limited functionality (manual login with no SSO, desktop-only, no request/auto-fill features) and required AD/SAP mappings and admin configuration. Adoption was moderate due to those constraints; SAP ended maintenance on May 16, 2025 and plans deletion by May 15, 2026, citing a strategic and technical shift toward cloud-native, cross-device integrations (e.g., Teams/Power Platform), security/maintenance concerns, and the need to migrate to more modern alternatives.",
