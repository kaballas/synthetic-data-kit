  "summary": "The OAuth IdP API (/oauth/idp) was an SAP endpoint used to generate SAML assertions for OAuth flows (notably in SuccessFactors) but was marked end-of-development on 2022-12-09 and scheduled for deletion on 2027-05-14 due to security risks from passing private keys through the API. Customers are advised to migrate to secure OAuth token endpoints (e.g., /oauth/token using Client Credentials or Authorization Code grants), SAP Cloud Identity Services or external IdPs, and to update integrations promptly to avoid unsupported, vulnerable integrations and downstream disruption.",
