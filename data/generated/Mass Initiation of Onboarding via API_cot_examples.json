  "summary": "The Mass Initiate Onboarding API lets SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding create or cancel onboarding journeys for multiple new hires/rehires in a single REST call, processing each candidate as an independent transaction (JSON payload, OAuth/HTTPS) so partial successes are possible and per-record success/failure details are returned. Best practices include batching within size/rate limits, robust per-record error handling and retry, secure OAuth and data-compliance measures (GDPR, encryption, role-based permissions), and integration/testing via sandbox/Postman and middleware for sync with Recruiting and Employee Central.",

The recommended batch size is 50, the API rate limit is 300 requests/minute, and each candidate has a 5% chance of transient failure requiring one retry. Assuming retries are re-sent in batches using the same batch size and count against the same rate limit, what are: (a) the initial number of API calls, (b) the expected number of retry API calls, and (c) the minimum time to complete all calls under the rate limit?",
