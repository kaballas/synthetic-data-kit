  "summary": "The document explains that SAP RBAC supports fine-grained field-level permissions (visibility, read-only, edit, hide) applied to user/account attributes and enforced across UI and APIs to meet governance and compliance needs. It describes the \"Account Data\" permission category\u2014covering personal/login attributes\u2014and distinguishes three granular rights: View Account Data (read-only), Edit Account Data (modify), and Unlock Login Accounts (toggle account lock status). Administrators assign and manage these permissions via the \"Manage Permission Roles\" UI or administrative APIs, which update RBAC metadata and control runtime behavior.",
