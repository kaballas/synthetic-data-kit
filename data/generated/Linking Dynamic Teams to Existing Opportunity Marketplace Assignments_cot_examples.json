  "summary": "The SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace is a centralized talent-mobility platform that uses an intelligent skills framework and AI to match employees to internal opportunities (projects, gigs, mentorship), while Dynamic Teams are flexible, skill- and project-based groups created or linked to those assignments to enable on-the-job learning and agile team formation. Assignment owners create and edit marketplace postings, link or form Dynamic Teams, and manage membership and collaboration via embedded UI and integrations with SuccessFactors modules, supported by role-based access, analytics, and trade-offs around change management and integration complexity.",
