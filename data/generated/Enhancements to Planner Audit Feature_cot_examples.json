  "summary": "### Summary\n\nThe Planner Audit feature in SAP SuccessFactors Compensation and Variable Pay templates provides field-level change history (initially up to 10, expanded to as many as 25 fields) so planners and managers can see who changed which compensation values and when, with exportable logs and template/version integration. Recent 2023\u20132025 enhancements added role-based permissions, UI and reporting improvements, executive-review filters, and deployment/configuration controls that boost accuracy, compliance, and transparency while requiring additional admin configuration and user training.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Inventory all candidate fields referenced in the text (compensation, variable pay, total compensation data points such as base salary, bonus target, merit percent, manager adjustments, eligibility flags, currency, FTE, one-time payments).\nStep 2: Map each field to business objectives: legal/regulatory requirements, high financial impact, frequent manual edits, or governance sensitivity.\nStep 3: Score fields by impact (e.g., regulatory = high, financial magnitude = high, edit frequency = high) and by expected edit volume to estimate system load.\nStep 4: Prioritize fields with the highest combined compliance/impact score, targeting an initial enablement of the top 10\u201315 to limit performance risk.\nStep 5: Pilot the selected set in one compensation cycle and measure performance (latency, export time) and audit usefulness (investigations avoided, reviewer feedback).\nStep 6: Based on pilot metrics, expand toward the 25-field cap incrementally, removing low-value fields if performance degrades.\nStep 7: Apply role-based visibility so only necessary users see audit logs, and document the field selection rationale for audit readiness.",
      "answer": "Start with the top 10\u201315 high-impact fields (regulatory, financial magnitude, frequent edits), pilot and measure performance, then incrementally expand up to 25 based on metrics and governance needs; restrict audit visibility by role."

      "question": "After Executive Review a manager notices unexpected compensation changes. Using Planner Audit, what step-by-step investigation and remediation actions should they follow to identify the source and restore correct worksheet state?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Export the Planner Audit change history for the affected worksheet and fields via Executive Review export functionality.\nStep 2: Filter the export by field, timestamp range, and user to isolate the specific changes and identify who made each modification and when.\nStep 3: Compare the audited previous and new values against the template version and worksheet version to determine whether the change originated from a user edit, a template update, or a system process.\nStep 4: If the change is unauthorized or incorrect, check whether the worksheet can be reverted to a prior version; if so, initiate a revert according to template/version rollback procedures.\nStep 5: If reward statements were issued, use the recall mechanism to retract statements for affected employees to avoid communicating incorrect compensation.\nStep 6: Document findings (user, reason, and corrective action), notify stakeholders, and adjust permissions or training to prevent recurrence.\nStep 7: Monitor subsequent cycles and audit exports to confirm corrective measures are effective.",
      "answer": "Export/filter the Planner Audit log by field/time/user, identify source (user edit vs. template change), revert worksheet version if needed, recall reward statements, document and remediate (permissions/training), then monitor results."
