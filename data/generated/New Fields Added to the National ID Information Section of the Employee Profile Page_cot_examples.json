  "summary": "The document outlines a planned comprehensive report on the newly added Valid From and Valid To fields for National ID Information in SAP Employee Central Payroll, covering their functional role, regulatory context, SAP release notes, implementation details, country-specific localization, data synchronization, validation logic, and change-management/testing implications. It concludes that the fields (date type) enforce temporal validation (Valid From \u2264 Valid To, no overlapping periods), improve compliance and auditability, and require coordinated updates to integrations, localizations, testing, and migration strategies.",
