  "summary": "The document summarizes SAP\u2019s Manage Documents UI, describing core features such as auto-save drafts, advanced search and filtering, metadata-driven displays, versioning, categorization (with ML-assisted proposals), storage visibility, and object linking, anchored by UX principles that prioritize intuitiveness, reduced cognitive load, and a side-by-side layout. It also outlines recent enhancements that boost navigation, situational awareness, and task accuracy, describes common pain points and usability evaluation methods (UCD, heuristics, task testing, SUS, analytics), and compares SAP\u2019s strong business-object integration and ML-driven classification favorably against competitors.",
