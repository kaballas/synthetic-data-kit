Inventory & classify: catalog 25 reports by usage, complexity, and data sources.\n2. Prioritize: rank by business impact and ease-of-migration (high-impact, low-complexity first).\n3. Map feature equivalence: for each report, map legacy features to July 2025 Story capabilities (visuals, filters, joins, AI summaries).\n4. Prototype: convert 1\u20132 representative reports to validate data joins, performance, and AI-story outputs.\n5. Validate: run functional, performance, security (role-based) tests with sample users; adjust data models and filters.\n6. Pilot roll-out: migrate a prioritized batch (e.g., 20\u201330% of reports) to production with parallel access to legacy reports.\n7. Training & documentation: deliver targeted training on AI-assisted storytelling, dynamic filters, and templates.\n8. Full rollout & retire legacy: migrate remaining reports, monitor usage and load metrics, decommission legacy reports iteratively.\n9. Continuous optimization: use performance tools and user feedback to tune schemas, joins, and visuals.\n10. Governance: enforce version control, access policies, and reproducible templates.\n",

Specify measurement methods, frequency, and success criteria for each KPI.\n4. Monitor post-migration over a defined period and compare to baselines.\n\nKPI selections and measurement methods:\n- Average story load time: measure median and 95th-percentile page load times from SAC access logs before and after migration; track weekly and aim for sustained reduction.\n- Report development cycle time: measure average hours/days from initial design to published Story (use ticketing/time-tracking data) before vs. after; track per-report and per-designer.\n- User adoption & engagement rate: measure active users/week, average session duration, and number of distinct Stories viewed per user from analytics; supplement with percentage of legacy reports retired.\n",
      "answer": "Track (1) average story load time via SAC logs (median & p95), (2) report development cycle time via time-tracking/tickets, and (3) user adoption/engagement via active users, session duration, and legacy-report retirement rate."
