  "summary": "The document summarizes SAP\u2019s enhancements to the Advanced Search \u201cSelect All\u201d for Goal Management \u2014 including expanded selection capacity (up to 500 recipients), persistent cross-page selections, clearer UI feedback, backend optimizations, and tighter integration with bulk goal actions. It also evaluates usability gains (faster workflows, fewer errors), recommends best practices (transparent selection state, confirmations, accessibility), and notes trade-offs such as implementation complexity and selection caps.",

What is the minimum number of Select All operations required to select all goals, what will the final (partial) batch contain, and how does that compare if the results are instead filtered into 30 evenly sized departments?",
      "reasoning": "- Identify total items and the Select All cap.\n- Compute full batches and remainder.\n- Compare with an alternative partitioning (30 equal departments).\nStep 1: Total items = 12,000. Select All cap per operation = 500.\nStep 2: Compute number of full batches = 12,000 \u00f7 500 = 24 exactly, remainder = 0.\nStep 3: Therefore minimum operations = 24; final partial batch size = 0 (all batches full).\nStep 4: If partitioned into 30 equal departments: items per department = 12,000 \u00f7 30 = 400.\nStep 5: Since 400 \u2264 500, each department can be selected with one operation \u2192 30 operations total.\nStep 6: Compare: 24 operations (no partitioning) vs. 30 operations (30-way partition) \u2014 partitioning into 30 equal groups increases the number of operations in this case.",
