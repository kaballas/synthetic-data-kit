  "summary": "Role-Based Permissions (RBP) in SAP Onboarding enforces least-privilege access using permission groups, permission roles, and target populations to control who can perform onboarding tasks. Poly RBP extends this model by allowing multiple roles to be assigned to a single custom task (implemented via MDF and a permission-resolution engine), increasing flexibility, scalability, and governance while introducing greater management complexity and potential for permission overlap. The document also provides best practices, troubleshooting guidance, and a stepwise admin workflow for safely implementing and auditing poly RBP configurations.",
