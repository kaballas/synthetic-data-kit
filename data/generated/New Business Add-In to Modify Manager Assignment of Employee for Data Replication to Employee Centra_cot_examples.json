  "summary": "The document explains that ECPAO_MNGR_TYPES_EXTRACTION determines employee managers for Employee Central by evaluating organizational-management relationship types and configurable evaluation paths, producing mapped manager records for replication to SuccessFactors. It also covers the Change Managerial Data BAdI (EX_ECPAO_ERP_MNGR_TYP_PDDATA / EX_ECPAO_MNGR_DATA_MODIFY), its configuration and implementation, common business scenarios (e.g., matrix or dotted-line reporting), downstream replication impacts, and best practices for performant, governed customizations.",

Apply evaluation-path depth rules: any manager reachable within technical depth \u2264 2 via configured evaluation paths will be found by the standard extractor; managers beyond that depth are not discovered by standard traversal.\n3.
