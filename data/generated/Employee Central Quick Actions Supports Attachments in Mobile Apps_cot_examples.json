  "summary": "The document outlines a plan to investigate Employee Central Quick Actions\u2014especially mobile attachment support\u2014by iteratively researching functionality, mobile vs. desktop differences, configuration and security, UX and performance, integrations, and best practices. Initial searches found foundational SAP documentation and release notes but identified gaps on attachment specifics and real-world issues, so the author will perform targeted searches and synthesize a detailed implementation and guidance report.",

      "question": "Can Employee Central Quick Actions on mobile securely collect onboarding documents (ID scans, signed forms) for an international rollout, and what exact configuration and limitations must be addressed?",
      "reasoning": "Checklist:\n- Verify platform/version and module prerequisites.\n- Configure Quick Action templates to include attachment fields.\n- Apply permissions, MFA, and encryption settings.\n- Integrate with Document Management System and retention policies.\n- Test UX, device compatibility, and performance.\n\nConcise, non-sensitive summary of steps and rationale:\n1) Confirm platform readiness: the feature requires SAP SuccessFactors platform version 2024 Q3+ and Employee Central core enabled. Without this baseline the mobile attachment capability is not available.\n2) Template configuration: add explicit attachment fields to each Quick Action template that needs documents; limit attachments per template to balance UX and storage.\n3) Supported file types and sizes: mobile Quick Actions accept PDF, JPG, PNG with a 10 MB per-file limit\u2014plan conversions for unsupported formats and educate users.\n4) Permissions and security: grant MDF/object upload permissions only to appropriate roles, enforce MFA for mobile users, and ensure HTTPS and at-rest encryption are active for attachment transport and storage.\n5) Integration and compliance: route attachments into the SuccessFactors Document Management System (or configured archive) with retention and data residency policies to meet GDPR/HIPAA/local laws.\n6) UX and device considerations: enable native picker/camera integration for iOS/Android, test on older OS versions (some Android OEMs may limit pickers), and implement client-side compression/validation to reduce failures.\n7) Monitoring and fallback: instrument upload success/error metrics, provide retry and offline guidance, and maintain support documentation for users.\n\nLimitations and mitigations (summary): file-type restriction (mitigate via conversion guidance), 10 MB limit (mitigate via compression or multi-file workflows), older device/network issues (mitigate via client-side checks and retry), and permission misconfigurations (mitigate via test roles and templates).\n",
      "answer": "Yes \u2014 mobile Quick Actions support onboarding document collection if you run SF platform 2024 Q3+, configure attachment fields, enforce role-based permissions and MFA, integrate with DMS/retention policies, and mitigate limits (PDF/JPG/PNG, 10 MB) via compression, conversion, and testing."

      "question": "Estimate monthly storage and bandwidth impact if 1,200 employees each submit an average of 1.5 attachments of 3 MB via mobile Quick Actions. What configuration changes reduce this impact?",
      "reasoning": "Checklist:\n- Calculate total number of attachments.\n- Compute raw storage from average file size.\n- Add overhead for thumbnails/metadata and estimate bandwidth.\n- Recommend configuration changes to reduce impact.\n\nConcise, non-sensitive calculation and recommendations:\n1) Total attachments = 1,200 employees * 1.5 attachments/employee = 1,800 attachments/month.\n2) Raw data = 1,800 attachments * 3 MB = 5,400 MB \u2248 5.4 GB/month.\n3) Account for overhead (thumbnails, metadata, indexing, replication): apply ~20% overhead \u2192 5.4 GB * 1.2 = 6.48 GB/month (\u2248 6.5 GB).\n4) Bandwidth considerations: each upload equals the attachment size plus TLS overhead; plan for peak concurrency (e.g., 5\u201310% of users uploading concurrently) to provision API throughput and mobile UX retries.\n5) Recommended config changes to reduce impact: enforce smaller per-file limits (where business-acceptable), enable client-side image compression/resizing, restrict allowed file types to avoid large formats, implement retention/archival policies to purge or archive old files to cheaper storage, and offload to external archive/integrated DMS if long-term retention is required.\n",
      "answer": "Expected monthly storage \u2248 6.5 GB including overhead (5.4 GB raw). To reduce impact, enforce size limits, enable client-side compression, apply retention/archival policies, and consider offloading long-term storage to an integrated DMS or archive."
