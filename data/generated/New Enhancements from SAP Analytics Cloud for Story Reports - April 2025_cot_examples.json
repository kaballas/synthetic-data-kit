  "summary": "The research compiles SAC Story report features, capabilities, and usage in People Analytics with a targeted focus on April 2025 enhancements and follow-up queries for documentation, technical details, comparisons, and best practices. Key findings: the April 2025 updates added Smart Insights in the Optimized Story experience (with pinning), enhanced multi-action workflows, broader live integrations (e.g., Google BigQuery), performance/usability improvements, and extended scripting/visualization support \u2014 all improving speed of insight, interactivity, and real\u2011time People Analytics workflows.",
