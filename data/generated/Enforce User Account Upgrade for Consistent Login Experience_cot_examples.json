  "summary": "The document defines a multi-step research plan to deeply analyze employment-based vs. account-based logins in SAP SuccessFactors\u2014covering definitions, technical implementations, upgrade mechanisms, user experience impacts, risks, compliance, best practices, and cross-platform lessons. It reports that targeted searches for official SAP and high-authority sources have begun, initially focusing on core differences, identity/linkage technical details, and motivations for upgrading to account-based logins, with the aim of producing a comprehensive strategy and technical guidelines.",

Here's a concise, non-sensitive summary of the logical approach:\nStep 1: Calculate counts from percentages against total users.\nStep 2: Sum groups that require manual remediation (contractors, duplicates, legacy integrations) as conservative estimate.\nStep 3: Design a phased rollout: small pilot to validate process, followed by evenly sized waves of the remaining users; include monitoring and rollback windows.\nStep 4: Provide numeric pilot and phase sizes consistent with total user count.",
