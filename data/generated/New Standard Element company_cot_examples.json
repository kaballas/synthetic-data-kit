Legal Entity records are: LE-A (country DE, start 2020-01-01, active), LE-B (country DE, start 2025-07-01, active), LE-C (country FR, start 2025-08-01, active). Which legal entity should be assigned as the employee's standard element company on 2025-07-15, and will payroll for July 2025 use the new legal entity if payroll run date is 2025-07-31?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Filter legal entities by country matching the employee (DE) \u2014 LE-A and LE-B remain.\nStep 2: Exclude entities with start dates after the employee effective date \u2014 LE-A (2020-01-01) and LE-B (2025-07-01) are both \u2264 2025-07-15, so both valid.\nStep 3: Prefer the most specific/recent active entity whose start date is the latest but \u2264 the employee effective date \u2014 that is LE-B (2025-07-01) over LE-A (2020-01-01).\nStep 4: Confirm active status for payroll integration \u2014 LE-B is active.\nStep 5: Determine payroll effectivity \u2014 payroll on 2025-07-31 will reflect the legal entity assigned as of the employee's effective date if integrations/HRIS Sync are completed before payroll cutoff.",
