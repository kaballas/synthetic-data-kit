SAP declared End of Maintenance (May 2024) and scheduled deletion (Nov 2025) to move to a cloud\u2011native, AI\u2011enabled successor with modern UX, personalization and better scalability; enterprises must plan data migration, retraining and integration updates, and SAP provides timelines, tools and migration guidance.",
