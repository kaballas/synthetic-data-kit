  "summary": "The report reviews SAP SuccessFactors mobile authentication and audit logging\u2014covering MFA, biometrics, token-based auth, and SSO\u2014summarizing common failure modes (password/token/MFA expiration, biometric errors, time sync and connectivity issues) and current logging of successes/failures with timestamps and device metadata.  \nIt recommends expanding audit coverage to capture granular failure codes (biometric, MFA, SSO, network, device attestation), centralizing tamper-evident logs with encryption and SIEM/analytics integration, and balancing this with privacy, performance, cross-platform consistency, and regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).  \nTechnical enablers include secure local logging, cloud aggregation, biometric SDK callbacks, device attestation, and data retention/encryption policies to improve forensic capability and compliance readiness.",
