  "summary": "The document summarizes a plan and initial research for a comprehensive technical and strategic report on SAP Learning\u2014comparing the legacy and new Learning experiences and focusing on proxy session mechanisms, redirection behaviors (including Enhanced Proxy Access), migration impacts, and administrative best practices. It records parallel searches that returned partial information, notes gaps in official SAP documentation, and commits to gathering authoritative SAP resources to produce an in-depth consolidated report covering architecture, authentication flows, redirection flags, operational challenges, and recommendations. The draft already begins an analysis contrasting legacy (table-driven, admin-focused) and new (responsive, user-centered, personalized) Learning home page designs.",

Below is a concise, non-sensitive summary and checklist of the logical steps to identify the flags and checks that control proxy-session redirection:\n- Check tenant-level feature toggles and migration rollout flags in the Learning admin console.\n- Inspect SAML assertion attributes issued by IAS or the corporate IdP for experience-assignment claims (e.g., experienceId, featureFlag, uiVersion).\n- Examine session cookies and local storage keys for experience markers set by the Learning backend or frontend (legacy_ui=true/new_ui=true).\n- Review middleware or reverse-proxy routing rules that map user context to target UI endpoints.\n- Validate admin-launch proxy configuration that injects or overrides claims during impersonation.\nSummary steps:\nStep 1: Confirm tenant-wide migration/feature toggle state in the Learning admin to know default experience routing.\nStep 2: Capture a proxy session SAML assertion and check for specific claims indicating UI assignment (experience or uiVersion). If present and set to the new experience, redirection is expected.\nStep 3: Inspect browser session cookies/local storage created at proxy launch for any flags used by the frontend to decide which UI to load.\nStep 4: Review any IAS conditional authentication rules or middleware route mapping that might override or translate claims into a redirect to the new experience.\nStep 5: If conflict exists (tenant toggle vs. claims), determine precedence (often tenant toggle or middleware rule) and correct the configuration.",
