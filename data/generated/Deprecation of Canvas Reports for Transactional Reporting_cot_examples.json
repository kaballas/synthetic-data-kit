  "summary": "Canvas reports (formerly Online Report Designer) are a multi-page reporting tool in SuccessFactors People Analytics that combine tables, charts, images and text for detailed transactional and replicated-data reporting, with export, scheduling and role-based permissions. SAP announced End of Development in Nov 2023 and deletion by Nov 2025, prompting concerns about migration complexity, loss of transactional parity and operational disruption. After strong customer feedback and gaps in successor tooling, SAP paused/withdrew the strict sunset timeline and committed to limited continued support while accelerating alternative solutions and a more gradual migration path.",

      "question": "Given an installed base of 120 Canvas reports of varying complexity and SAP's withdrawn EoD/deletion timelines, how should an enterprise structure a prioritized, resource-aware migration program to People Stories/SAC to minimize operational disruption and complete migration within a realistic timeframe?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - Identify key facts and constraints from the provided text.\n  - Define reasonable assumptions for report complexity and effort per category.\n  - Break the migration into phases and compute effort and duration using assumed team capacity.\n  - Propose prioritization rules and risk mitigations.\n\nStep 1: Extract facts and constraints from the text: Canvas reports remain supported but development is limited; alternatives (People Stories/SAC) lack full parity for some transactional features; SAP has withdrawn hard deletion dates, giving breathing room.\n\nStep 2: Define assumptions (explicit to make timeline calculable): classify 120 reports into simple (40%), medium (40%), complex (20%) \u2192 counts: 48 simple, 48 medium, 24 complex. Typical effort per report (including re-design, data validation, testing, stakeholder sign-off): simple = 1 person-day, medium = 3 person-days, complex = 8 person-days. Team capacity: 3 full-time analysts available for migration work (assume 20 productive days/month each). Allow 20% contingency for unexpected issues and parallel activities (training, governance).\n\nStep 3: Compute raw effort: simple = 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 PD; medium = 48 \u00d7 3 = 144 PD; complex = 24 \u00d7 8 = 192 PD. Total raw = 384 person-days. Add 20% contingency \u2192 384 \u00d7 1.2 = 460.8 \u2248 461 person-days.\n\nStep 4: Translate to calendar time with 3-person team: monthly capacity = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 PD/month. Duration = 461 / 60 \u2248 7.68 months \u2248 8 months. If you can scale to 5 analysts (100 PD/month), duration \u2248 4.6 months.\n\nStep 5: Define phases and prioritization rules to minimize disruption:\n  - Phase 0 (4 weeks): inventory & dependency analysis, classify reports, identify critical business owners, capture outputs/SLAs, build migration templates and test harnesses.\n  - Phase 1 (month 2\u20133): Migrate high-priority critical operational reports (top 20% by business impact) \u2014 run in dual mode and validate.\n  - Phase 2 (months 3\u20136): Migrate medium-priority reports and train broader user base.\n  - Phase 3 (months 6\u20138): Migrate low-priority and archival reports; decommission Canvas instances gradually.\n\nStep 6: Risk mitigations and validation: maintain dual-run for each migrated report until validated for two reporting cycles; keep Canvas available for complex transactional reports until feature parity achieved; engage SAP/partners for complex conversions; schedule recurring stakeholder demos.\n\nStep 7: Deliverable timeline summary: with 3 analysts, expect ~8 months end-to-end (including contingency and governance). Scale team to shorten duration. Prioritize critical reports first, keep dual-run, and reserve Canvas for remaining gaps until parity is confirmed.",
      "answer": "Recommended migration program: run an 8-month phased plan with a 3-analyst team (\u2248461 person-days including 20% contingency). Phase 0: 4 weeks inventory; Phase 1: 2 months for top 20% critical reports; Phase 2: next 3 months for medium-priority; Phase 3: final ~2 months for low-priority and decommissioning. Use dual-run, formal validation, and engage SAP/partners for complex conversions; scale team to shorten the schedule."

      "question": "Based on the synthesized evidence about Canvas reports and People Stories/SAC, can People Stories fully replace Canvas reports for live transactional, row-level operational reporting today? If not, which exact capabilities are lacking and what hybrid approach should be used until parity is achieved?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will take:\n  - List key capability dimensions from the provided text.\n  - Compare Canvas and People Stories/SAC on each dimension using explicit evidence.\n  - Identify capability gaps and operational consequences.\n  - Recommend a pragmatic hybrid approach and interim controls.\n\nStep 1: Identify capability dimensions mentioned in the text: real-time transactional data access, row-level/detail list reporting, query/save on replicated data (Advanced Reporting), export formats (PPT/PDF/Word/Excel), scheduling/distribution, permissions and governance, visualization/storytelling features.\n\nStep 2: Compare capabilities (summary):\n  - Real-time transactional access: Canvas (Detailed Reporting) supports live queries; People Stories/SAC aims for cross-suite data but initially lacked full parity for live, row-level transactional granularity.\n  - Row-level/list reports: Canvas excels at multi-page, detailed list reports; People Stories focuses on visual narrative and aggregated views, with weaker row-level table export and detailed transactional layouts.\n  - Saved queries on replicated sources: Advanced Reporting parallels exist in SAC but migration complexity and template parity are limited.\n  - Exports and scheduling: Canvas supports rich exports (PPT/PDF/Word/Excel) and scheduling; People Stories supports online sharing and PDFs but may not fully replicate all export formatting or scheduled email behaviors.\n  - Permissions/governance: Both platforms support role-based controls, but embedded SuccessFactors metadata sync and existing permission mappings favor Canvas today.\n\nStep 3: Identify gaps and impacts: primary gaps are live row-level transactional parity, some export/scheduling nuances, and certain Advanced Reporting query templates. The operational impact is potential loss of exact-report formatting, real-time list outputs, and some automated distribution behaviors if migrated prematurely.\n\nStep 4: Recommend hybrid approach until parity: maintain Canvas for critical transactional/list reports while migrating analytics and narrative dashboards to People Stories/SAC; implement dual-run validation; recreate aggregated dashboards and interactive story elements first; for each report, map functional requirements (real-time row-level vs. aggregated insight) and migrate accordingly; pursue custom connectors or API-based extracts for critical live feeds where SAC lacks direct parity; engage SAP updates to track parity improvements and retire Canvas only after validated feature coverage.\n\nStep 5: Operational controls: inventory-dependent gating, stakeholder sign-off after two validation cycles, training plan for users, and a timeline tied to SAC/People Stories feature releases rather than fixed deletion dates.",
      "answer": "No \u2014 People Stories/SAC does not fully replace Canvas for live, row-level transactional reporting today. Missing/limited capabilities: real-time row-level detail and list-report parity, some export and scheduled-distribution behaviors, and certain Advanced Reporting query templates. Interim recommendation: adopt a hybrid model \u2014 keep Canvas for critical transactional/list reports, migrate aggregated and narrative analytics to People Stories/SAC, use dual-run validation, and retire Canvas only after confirmed parity and stakeholder sign-off."
