  "summary": "The document analyzes iOS (2025) screenshot and screen\u2011recording architecture and security\u2014covering system APIs (UIKit/AVFoundation), detection limits (e.g., `UIScreen.isCaptured` detects recording but not user screenshots), DRM/protected\u2011content flags, and user permission/sandbox constraints. It then reviews how EMM/MDM (notably SAP Mobile Services) enforces capture restrictions via Apple MDM and managed app configs, proactive masking techniques (overlays/redaction), UX and compliance considerations (GDPR/HIPAA), auditing, known limitations and bypass risks, and recommends an integrated enterprise strategy.",
