It also outlines required technical/configuration prerequisites and describes a plan to run targeted queries to collect deeper detail on data quality, compliance, adoption challenges, competitor comparisons, case studies, and ROI for a comprehensive report.",

      "reasoning": "- Checklist of steps I will follow:\n  - Identify required Job Information fields and effective-date rules.\n  - Validate and normalize legacy records for continuity and completeness.\n  - Define mapping rules to Employee Central fields and payroll Infotype 0001.\n  - Create test migration with validations, reconcile results, then deploy and monitor.\nStep 1: Catalog required fields and rules from the provided text: effective-dated Job Information, position, company, cost center, employment type, and mappings to payroll Infotype 0001. Ensure foundation objects exist for positions and org units.\nStep 2: Validate source data for each employee: detect overlaps, gaps, missing mandatory values, and inconsistent code values. Flag records with non-contiguous date ranges or missing mandatory fields.\nStep 3: Normalize records: split or merge legacy entries to produce contiguous, effective-dated sequences with no gaps; apply defaulting rules where business-justified and document assumptions.\nStep 4: Define field mappings to Employee Central and to Infotype 0001 (payroll): map job codes, position IDs, company/cost center, employment type, and effective dates; standardize code value mappings for interoperability.\nStep 5: Build migration scripts that enforce validations (no-gap checks, mandatory fields, standardized codes) and produce audit logs for each transformation.\nStep 6: Run a pilot migration on a representative subset; reconcile migrated Job Information against source and simulate payroll runs to confirm Infotype 0001 mappings produce expected results.\nStep 7: Remediate issues found in pilot, finalize cutover plan, execute full migration, and enable post-migration monitoring and exception workflows for any residual gaps or mapping errors.",
