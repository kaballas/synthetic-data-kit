  "summary": "The search targeted deep technical details about SAP SuccessFactors Continuous Performance and multi-goal linking but found limited publicly available architecture- or update-specific sources, with most results offering high-level functional context. The report therefore synthesizes gathered documentation and common enterprise/SAP design patterns to provide in-depth insights on data models, goal-plan relationships, many-to-many activity-to-goal linking, UI/API interactions, integrations, and update implications.",
