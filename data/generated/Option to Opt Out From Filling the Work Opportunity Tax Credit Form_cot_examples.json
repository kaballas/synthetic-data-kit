  "summary": "The document explains that the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), codified in IRC \u00a751 and administered by the IRS and DOL, gives employers a wage-based federal tax credit (typically up to 40% of first-year wages, max $2,400, with higher limits for some veterans) to incentivize hiring from defined target groups (veterans, TANF, SNAP recipients, ex-felons, SSI recipients, long-term unemployed, etc.). It also summarizes onboarding and compliance: employers must pre-screen hires with IRS Form 8850 and ETA Form 9061, submit them to the State Workforce Agency within 28 days to obtain ETA Form 9062 certification, retain records for audits, and manage timing, privacy, and documentation obligations\u2014often via electronic onboarding or third-party vendors.",
