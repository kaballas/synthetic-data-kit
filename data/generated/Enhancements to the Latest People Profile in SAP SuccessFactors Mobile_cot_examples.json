  "summary": "The document states the user will fetch and analyze official SAP SuccessFactors release notes and documentation to produce a detailed report on the People Profile mobile enhancements, focusing on architecture, functionality, cross\u2011module impacts, usability, development practices, and security. The findings indicate People Profile is a cloud\u2011based, microservices\u2011oriented feature tightly integrated with Employee Central and other modules, with mobile UX improvements (Profile Preview, Spotlight, org charts), enhanced APIs and real\u2011time sync, and cross\u2011product impacts on payroll, goals, benefits, time management, and rewards.",
