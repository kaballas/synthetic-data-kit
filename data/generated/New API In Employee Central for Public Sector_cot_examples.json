  "summary": "SAP Employee Central is the cloud-based core HR system in SAP SuccessFactors; its Public Sector Management (PSM) extension maps HR data to public\u2011sector finance constructs (cost centers, funds, grants), supports MDF\u2011based extensibility, and integrates with SAP S/4HANA and external systems via OData/JSON/XML using OAuth/SAML and SAP Master Data Integration. \n\nA focused search found no public documentation for an EmpEmploymentHigherDuty API, so the document proposes inferring its purpose, design, security, integration, and operational guidance from general Employee Central/PSM API patterns and producing a comprehensive synthesized report.",
