  "summary": "The initial tool results returned authoritative SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Time Off documentation (features, setup, and recent mobile changes) but left gaps around SAP Business AI impacts and transactional migration details. The plan is to deeply analyze the \"View time off instructions\" use case\u2014covering its shift from navigational to transactional scenarios, mobile/technology/integration implications, compliance and challenges, and architectural/technical/strategic recommendations\u2014supplementing with additional searches where needed.",
