It also summarizes technical integration mechanisms (REST/SOAP APIs, SAP CPI/Integration Suite, provisioning and field mappings), filtering/reporting use, common synchronization and configuration challenges, stakeholder use cases, and best practices for automation and visibility.",

      "question": "If onboarding initiation is triggered at 10:00:00, middleware adds up to 2 minutes of processing, and Recruiting polls Onboarding status every 5 minutes on the clock (:00, :05, :10...), what are the minimum, maximum, and expected delays before the \"Onboarding Status\" in Recruiting shows \"In Progress\"?",
      "reasoning": "- Checklist:\n- Verify integration pattern (polling at fixed clock intervals)\n- Account for middleware processing latency\n- Calculate timing scenarios (best, worst, expected)\n- Provide concise numeric outcomes\n\nStep 1: Define the timeline elements: initiation event at t0 = 10:00:00, middleware latency L = up to 2 minutes, polling interval P = 5 minutes aligned to :00/:05/:10.\nStep 2: Best-case scenario: initiation occurs just before a poll and middleware completes before that poll. The earliest observable delay equals middleware latency if middleware finishes before the next scheduled poll. Minimum delay = L = 2 minutes.\nStep 3: Worst-case scenario: initiation occurs just after a poll, and middleware latency causes the first subsequent poll to miss the update, forcing wait until the following poll. Worst-case delay = P + L = 5 + 2 = 7 minutes.\nStep 4: Expected (average) delay assuming uniform distribution of initiation times across the polling window: average wait for next poll \u2248 P/2 = 2.5 minutes; add middleware latency L => expected delay \u2248 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 minutes.\nStep 5: Summarize operational implications: configure webhooks or reduce polling interval to lower delays; ensure middleware processes idempotently to avoid retries causing further lag.",
