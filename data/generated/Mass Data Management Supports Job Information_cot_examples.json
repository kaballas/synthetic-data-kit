  "summary": "The document explains that Mass Data Management (MDM) in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central is a Fiori-based tool now extended to support Job Information, enabling bulk edits of employee job records (titles, codes, departments, employment history) via an intuitive UI while preserving validity, audit trails, and approval controls. It outlines the architecture (metadata-driven EC data model, centralized services, OData APIs), workflow changes (synchronous processing limits, enhanced validation/preview and approval support) and business benefits such as faster reorganizations, promotions, and improved data integrity, and recommends deeper review of error handling, automation, and best practices.",
