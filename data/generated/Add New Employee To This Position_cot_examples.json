  "summary": "The document explains that the \"Add New Employee To This Position\" feature in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central lets HR initiate a new\u2011hire flow directly from a Position Org Chart node, prefilling and locking position-derived fields (position ID, job code, org unit, location, cost center, FTE) to ensure structural integrity and reduce manual data entry. It also summarizes required configurations (enable Position Management, permission roles, field mappings, provisioning jobs) and highlights how organizational design (hierarchical vs. matrix, position\u2011 vs. job\u2011centric) plus effective dating influence implementation, customization, security, and reporting.",

      "answer": "Position ID, job code/profile, department/organizational unit, location/site, employee classification (FT/PT), cost center/business unit, time type, and standard weekly hours are prefilled and set read-only because they derive from the authoritative position master data to maintain structural and data integrity."
