  "summary": "The document summarizes research on the old \"Position Below User's Position in Hierarchy\" rule function in SAP Employee Central, describing its purpose, functionality, common use cases, technical scope, and limitations versus newer rule functions. It also records that SAP announced End of Development on May 15, 2025 with removal planned for 1H 2026, and outlines focused search queries to collect official EoD details, replacement plans, migration best practices, and community feedback.",

      "answer": "Adopt a five-phase approach: (1) full inventory and classification, (2) mapping to new functions, (3) sandbox prototyping for high-impact cases, (4) staged UAT and incremental production rollout, and (5) post-deployment monitoring with rollback plans; prioritize high-impact workflows first to minimize disruption."

      "answer": "Key risks are workflow failures, permission regressions, migration time/resource strain, behavioral mismatches, and stakeholder unreadiness; mitigations include early inventory and testing, staged rollouts with fallbacks, access validation, output comparison and tuning, and clear communication plus training."

      "question": "How do the planned 1H 2026 replacement rule functions address the limitations of the old \"Position Below User's Position in Hierarchy\" function, and what concrete benefits should organizations expect?",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: List old limitations from the text: single hierarchy type (position-only), rigid binary output, limited configurability, poor support for matrix/indirect relations, and harder extensibility.\nStep 2: Match each limitation to the described new capabilities: support for multiple hierarchy types (position, matrix, job), configurable filters including indirect reports, enriched output (metadata), improved API integration, and better performance.\nStep 3: Derive concrete operational benefits: more accurate access/validation rules across complex org models, reduced custom workarounds, easier integration into workflows and extensions, better auditability via richer outputs, and likely performance gains.\nStep 4: Note residual considerations: organizations must remap rules and validate behavioral parity; benefits realized after migration and testing.",
      "answer": "The new functions remove position-only constraints by supporting multiple hierarchy types and indirect relations, provide configurable parameters and richer outputs, and improve API and performance. Organizations will gain more accurate rule enforcement across complex orgs, fewer custom workarounds, better integration and auditability, and improved runtime efficiency once migrated."
