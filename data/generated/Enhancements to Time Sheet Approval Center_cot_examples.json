  "summary": "The document outlines an iterative plan to address ten deep questions about SAP\u2019s Time Sheet Approval Center (TSAC) and summarizes TSAC\u2019s pre\u2011enhancement state as a centralized manager-facing interface for reviewing, analyzing, and approving time sheets\u2014consolidating planned vs. actual hours, missing punches, amendments, and alerts\u2014but with limited interaction, filtering, and role-based action capabilities. It also explains Role\u2011Based Permissions (RBP) as a least\u2011privilege framework that assigns scoped read/write/approve rights to roles, enforces authorization checks across UI and backend, and enables the recent enhancements that expose finer-grained, role\u2011controlled action links and contextual \u201ckey facts\u201d to improve approval decisioning.",
