  "summary": "The document describes SAP SuccessFactors' planned migration from a deprecated legacy MIME scheme to the Mozilla/IANA MIME registry (deprecation begins 14 Nov 2025, full removal by Nov 2026), highlighting improved global interoperability, authoritative MIME definitions, and minimal expected runtime disruption as the backend reconciles mappings. It recommends inventorying existing mappings, automated normalization, content-based validation, comprehensive testing and monitoring, and updating integrations and training, with SAP and IANA/Mozilla providing documentation and support.",

An automated normalization script maps 92% of documents to IANA types correctly, flags 3% as ambiguous, and fails to map 5% (requires fallback heuristics).
