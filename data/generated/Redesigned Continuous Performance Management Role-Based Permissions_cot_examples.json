  "summary": "The document reports that the initial search returned broad RBAC best-practice material but lacked CPM-specific details, so the next steps target RBAC design for CPM platforms, permission categories, data vs UI access separation, SAP Performance & Goals, and security/auditability evidence. It then fetches general RBAC resources and SAP-specific docs and will synthesize those findings into a comprehensive report covering architecture, permission taxonomy, segregation of data/UI permissions, security implications, auditability, and recommendations for CPM environments.",

      "reasoning": "Checklist:\n- Identify distinct business tasks and who performs them.\n- Split permissions into Data (read/write/approve) vs UI (feature/button visibility).\n- Apply least-privilege and separation-of-duties constraints.\n- Map each role to minimal permission sets and note constraints.\nStep 1: Enumerate tasks: submit self-review, view/edit own goals, manager view team, provide manager review, approve/reject reviews, HR audit/configure.\nStep 2: Define data permissions (granular): \"ReadOwn\", \"WriteOwn\", \"ReadTeam\", \"WriteTeam\", \"ApproveTeam\", \"AuditAll\", \"AdminConfig\".\nStep 3: Define UI permissions separately: \"UI_SubmitReviewForm\", \"UI_EditOwnGoals\", \"UI_TeamDashboard\", \"UI_ApproveButton\", \"UI_AdminConsole\".\nStep 4: Apply least privilege: grant only those data/UI perms needed for each role's tasks.\nStep 5: Enforce separation-of-duties constraints: ensure the actor who has \"WriteOwn\" and submits a review cannot also hold \"ApproveTeam\" for the same review cycle; enforce via role constraints or workflow checks.\nStep 6: Produce minimal mapping and note enforcement approach (role assignment + attribute checks + workflow guards).",
      "answer": "Minimal mapping:\n- Employee: Data = {ReadOwn, WriteOwn}; UI = {UI_SubmitReviewForm, UI_EditOwnGoals}.\n- Manager: Data = {ReadTeam, WriteTeam (comments/recommendations), ApproveTeam}; UI = {UI_TeamDashboard, UI_ApproveButton} but scoped to direct reports only.\n- HR Admin: Data = {ReadAll, AuditAll, AdminConfig}; UI = {UI_AdminConsole, UI_AuditReports}; restrict HR from approving items they edited via a SOD constraint enforced in IAM/workflow.\nEnforcement: use scoped data filters (team/direct-report), attribute-based constraints, and workflow guards to prevent submitter==approver; log all actions for auditability."

      "reasoning": "Checklist:\n- Calculate naive role-count using combinatorics.\n- Identify attribute-based alternatives and inheritance patterns.\n- Define how to separate data vs UI using attributes rather than new roles.\n- Provide resulting reduced role set and rationale.\nStep 1: Naive count: if you create distinct roles per region (5) \u00d7 job family (4) \u00d7 functional role types (assume 6 typical functional roles: Employee, Manager, HR, HR Admin, Auditor, System Admin) then naive roles = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 = 120 roles.\nStep 2: Identify attributes to avoid combinatorial explosion: keep core functional roles (6) and apply region/job-family scope via attributes/claims (region, jobFamily, orgUnit) instead of unique role objects.\nStep 3: Separate permissions into two orthogonal axes: (A) functional permission sets attached to core roles; (B) data scope attributes (region, job family, team) applied at session/evaluation-time.\nStep 4: Use role inheritance and templates: define base role templates and allow delegations for temporary elevated access via entitlement groups or just-in-time provisioning.\nStep 5: Resulting practical role count = ~6 core roles + a small number of administrative/system roles (e.g., 2\u20134) = ~8\u201310 roles; all scoping done via attributes and dynamic groups.",
