  "summary": "The document outlines an investigation into People Search for enterprise mobile apps (iOS/Android), summarizing core features and a 10-point research plan covering recent release notes, UX/performance metrics, underlying technologies, challenges, security/compliance, productivity impact, evaluation methods, and strategic recommendations. Searches against SAP and related sources were executed and documentation fetched, and a comprehensive in-depth report focusing on technical details, UX implications, security, and future recommendations is being prepared.",
