## Report on Separate Import and Export Permissions in SAP Metadata Framework

### 1. Metadata Framework and Current Permission Management

The Metadata Framework (MDF) within the SAP Platform Foundation Management is a core part of SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite that enables configuration of metadata-driven objects and business logic. It allows customers and administrators to create, manage, and maintain customizable entities or objects that tailor the SAP system behavior to business needs.

Permissions within MDF are managed primarily via Role-Based Permissions (RBP). These permissions control access and actions on MDF objects at both the page level (representing broader UI or functional sections) and object level (specific business objects/entities). Important permissions include view, edit, import, and export capabilities.

Until early 2025, permissions related to import and export functions were combined under both page-level and object-level controls. This meant a user with the "Import Permission" on a page also implicitly had export capabilities, and vice versa, often creating ambiguity and potential security risks in managing sensitive data transfers.

### 2. Previous Combined Import/Export Permissions

Previously, the import and export permissions in MDF were grouped as a single combined permission for both page and object levels. The security scope was such that:

- With the page-level Import/Export permission enabled, users could both import (upload) and export (download) data across MDF objects on that page.
- At the object-level, granting Import/Export permission gave users access to both import and export operations on that specific MDF object.

This approach mainly affected administrators and power users responsible for data management and configuration. Typical use cases included:

- Mass updates to configuration data by importing spreadsheets.
- Exporting MDF objects for backup or audit purposes.
- Data migrations and integration activities involving importing and exporting data.

The combined permission model simplified initial administration but lacked granularity, making it challenging to enforce strict separation of duties. It also risked users performing unintended data exports or imports if their role permissions were too broadly configured.

### 3. Motivation for Permission Segregation

Multiple factors motivated SAP to split import and export permissions into separate entities within the Metadata Framework:

- **Security considerations:** Exporting data poses different security risks than importing. Export can lead to unintended data leaks, while import can introduce erroneous or malicious data. Separation reduces risk by allowing more precise control.
- **User feedback:** Customers and administrators expressed need for finer-grained permission control to align with internal security policies and compliance requirements.
- **Compliance requirements:** Data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and governance frameworks demand strict access controls differentiated by data export versus import capabilities.
- **Product updates and SAP notes:** Around Q1-Q2 2025, SAP released update notes and technical bulletins introducing the split, such as the Knowledge Base Article (KBA) 3584065 and Mettle SAP SuccessFactors release information notes dated March to May 2025. These documents explain the change and provide guidance for implementation.

Thus, the segregation was driven by the dual aims of enhancing security and improving user experience by clarifying permission scopes.

### 4. Technical and Architectural Changes for Split Permissions

The split of import and export permissions at both the page and object level required the following technical and architectural adjustments:

- **Creation of distinct permission entities:** Instead of a combined Import/Export permission on pages and objects, two separate permissions were defined: one for Import and another for Export.
- **UI permission configuration changes:** The MDF permission management UI and RBP configuration screens were updated to allow administrators to select import and export permissions independently for pages and objects.
- **Backend enforcement mechanisms:** The metadata permission enforcement layer in SAP SuccessFactors platform was modified to check for respective import or export permissions before granting access to respective functions.
- **Visibility and access control:** Objects without the explicit export permission are hidden from the UI export dialogs; similarly, import functionalities like "Download Template" and "Import Config" are visible only with Import permission.
- **Affected components:** The permission framework services, MDF UI components, and APIs involved in metadata import/export underwent modification. The SAP SuccessFactors Role-Based Permission (RBP) engine also incorporated new permission attributes to enforce segregation.

### 5. Operation of New Separate Import and Export Permissions

In practice, the separate import and export permissions operate as follows:

- **Page-level permissions:** Users need to have the "Import Permission on Metadata Framework" to see and operate import functions for objects on that page. Similarly, "Export Permission on Metadata Framework" is required to export any data.
- **Object-level permissions:** At the granular object level, users can be assigned import permission, export permission, both, or neither independently. This controls visibility and capability for each specific MDF object.
- **Permission workflows:** When assigning roles in Admin Center → Manage Permission Roles, administrators now select import and export permissions separately both at page and object scopes.
- **UI changes:** Import and export buttons and options on the MDF UI are enabled or disabled dynamically based on respective permissions. Users without export permission do not see export options for objects.
- **Backend checks:** The platform backend verifies user permissions on import and export operations before processing requests, ensuring security enforcement regardless of UI state.
- **Non-secured objects:** For MDF objects classified as non-secured, users need explicit access permission for both import and export to use respective functions.

### 6. Benefits and Challenges of Separate Permissions

**Benefits:**

- Enhanced security by separation of duties; export and import roles can be assigned differently.
- Better compliance adherence for data governance policies.
- More precise user experience, as irrelevant functions are hidden, reducing user errors.
- Simplified audit trails for import and export activities.
- Flexibility in tailoring role permissions to business needs.

**Challenges:**

- Increased complexity in managing roles with more granular permissions.
- Potential for misconfiguration if administrators are not well-trained on the new model.
- Transition period challenges for organizations migrating from combined to split permission schemes.
- Risk of overlooking object-level permissions leading to unexpected access issues.

### 7. Managing and Auditing Separate Permissions

Effective management and auditing can be achieved by:

- Regularly reviewing assigned import and export permissions in RBP to ensure least privilege principle.
- Using SAP SuccessFactors audit logs to track import and export operations and associate them with permission assignments.
- Implementing automated compliance checks to detect unauthorized permissions.
- Training administrators on distinction between import and export rights and their business implications.
- Employing SAP tools and reports designed for MDF permission oversight.

### 8. Case Studies and Best Practices

While specific documented case studies are not publicly abundant yet due to the recent introduction of this change, SAP community forums, SAP Notes, and Knowledge Base Articles advise the following:

- Gradually roll out import/export permission changes, starting with test users.
- Use role templates with default separated permissions to prevent misconfiguration.
- Collect end-user and admin feedback post-implementation to refine role designs.
- Document permission mapping for audit and compliance purposes.

### 9. Comparison with Other Enterprise Platforms

Other enterprise metadata management frameworks and platforms, such as Oracle, Microsoft Power Platform, and Salesforce, also often separate import and export or data write and read permissions for sensitive operations. SAP's approach aligns with industry best practices emphasizing:

- Principle of least privilege,
- Segregation of duties,
- Role granularity,
- Auditability and compliance.

SAP’s split permissions model is consistent with these frameworks, focusing on practical and secure permission granularity.

### 10. Comprehensive Guidelines and Recommendations

Organizations adopting the separated import and export permissions in SAP’s Metadata Framework should follow these guidelines:

- Clearly differentiate roles for data importers and exporters enforcing segregation of duties.
- Start with a full permissions audit and mapping of current roles to identify necessary changes.
- Educate administrators and end-users on new permission impacts and workflows.
- Test permission assignments extensively in a sandbox environment before production.
- Regularly monitor and audit import/export operations for compliance and security.
- Leverage SAP-provided KBAs, product update notes, and community knowledge for ongoing improvements.
- Document permission settings and role definitions thoroughly for governance.
