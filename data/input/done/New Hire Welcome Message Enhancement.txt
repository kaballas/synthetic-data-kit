## Best Practices & Common Standards for Manager Contact Information Display in New Hire Onboarding

Current best practices for displaying manager contact information in new hire onboarding messages emphasize clarity, privacy, and usability. The manager’s phone number, if included, is typically presented in an internationally recognizable format (e.g., E.164 format with + country code prefix) to avoid confusion and ensure accessibility regardless of the new hire's location. The number is usually displayed with clear labels (e.g., "Manager’s Phone: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX") and sometimes accompanied by alternative contact methods (email, office location). Organizations often prioritize displaying only necessary contact information to maintain privacy and minimize potential misuse. Thus, personal or direct mobile numbers may be avoided or obfuscated.

Privacy considerations are paramount. The contact details should be shared with new hires only after consent from the managers. Manager contact information is often protected under company policies and relevant regulations to ensure it is not publicly exposed.

Additionally, onboarding platforms encourage including multiple communication channels to increase accessibility—for example, phone, email, and chat handles, with phone numbers presented in a user-friendly and standardized format. These practices align with digital onboarding trends focusing on seamless communication and connectivity for new hires from Day 1.[1][5]

## Implementation & Customization in Onboarding Platforms Including SAP Onboarding

Onboarding software solutions vary in how they implement and display manager phone numbers in new hire communications. Common patterns include automated template-based insertion, where manager contact details are dynamically pulled from HR information systems (HRIS) or employee master data.

SAP’s Onboarding module allows customization of welcome messages through content templates and integration with SAP SuccessFactors or other HRIS systems. The phone number field can be configured in these templates, with options for formatting either via predefined rules or custom coding using SAP Cloud Platform extensions or Business Rules. The system supports internationalization features to handle countries’ phone number differences.

Customization options usually include:

- Formatting templates for phone number display (e.g., adding country code prefixes, spacing)
- Conditional logic to decide if the number is displayed or masked based on privacy constraints or role
- Localization support to display phone numbers as per the new hire’s locale formatting standards
- Integration with telephony systems where the phone number may be rendered clickable (tel: links) in digital messages or portals.

SAP documentation provides detailed steps to update email templates, change phone number formats by editing the relevant template content or extending system logic using SAP’s side-by-side extensibility framework.[5][7][1]

## User Experience (UX) & Employee Feedback

UX research and employee feedback emphasize the importance of clarity, accessibility, and trustworthiness in displaying manager contact info. New hires often feel more welcomed and connected when manager contact numbers are clearly and correctly formatted and easy to find within onboarding messages.

Issues arise when phone numbers are presented in inconsistent or confusing formats—such as local-only formats without international codes for remote workers—or when contact info is buried in long text, leading to missed opportunities for connection.

Accessibility-wise, clickable phone numbers on digital platforms (mobile and desktop) improve ease of use. Displaying a clear label (e.g., "Your manager’s direct phone") enhances understanding.

However, privacy concerns sometimes result in negative feedback if employees feel their managers’ personal numbers are exposed without consent. Clear communication about why and how contact details are shared can mitigate this. Overall, a balance between openness and discretion improves onboarding satisfaction.[4][5]

## Privacy, Security, and Compliance Regulations

Key regulations impacting manager phone number display in onboarding include:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, EU): Requires explicit consent for processing and displaying personal data, including phone numbers. Data minimization principle applies—only necessary contact data should be shared with new hires. Managers should be informed and consent to sharing their personal or direct mobile numbers.
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act, USA): Similar emphasis on personal data privacy and the right to know and opt-out. Phone numbers considered personal data and should be safeguarded.
- Industry-specific guidelines (e.g., healthcare HIPAA considerations, financial sector regulations) may impose additional restrictions on how employee contact info is shared to avoid security risks.

Organizations interpret these regulations conservatively, often defaulting to displaying corporate or role-based contact numbers rather than personal lines. They implement security by limiting access to onboarding messages to authenticated users and applying encryption for data in transit and at rest.[3][5]

## Technical Challenges & Common Pitfalls

Technical challenges in changing phone number display formats in automated onboarding messages include:

- Internationalization: Handling multiple country codes, variable number lengths, and local dialing conventions. Incorrect formatting can confuse or frustrate new hires.
- Data consistency: Ensuring phone number data in HRIS is accurate and normalized before displaying; inconsistent HR data leads to display issues.
- Integration: Linking phone number data with telephony or communication tools (e.g., click-to-call links) can require complex backend workflows.
- Template limitations: Some onboarding platforms have limited formatting capabilities for email templates, necessitating custom scripting or external service integrations.
- Privacy control: Implementing logic to hide or mask phone numbers based on permissions or employee roles can be error-prone.

Common pitfalls include displaying incomplete or unformatted numbers, exposing personal mobile numbers unintentionally, and failure to handle multiple locales leading to poor user experience.[2][9]

## Measuring Effectiveness & Impact

Organizations measure the impact of modifications to contact info display in onboarding by tracking:

- New hire engagement metrics: Email open rates, click-throughs on phone number links, responses to welcome messages.
- Manager-new hire connection rates: How quickly and frequently new hires contact or meet their managers after onboarding.
- Onboarding satisfaction surveys: Direct feedback from new hires regarding clarity and usefulness of provided contact info.
- Retention and productivity metrics: Long-term indicators linked to quality onboarding communication.

Some companies run A/B tests modifying phone number presentations (e.g., adding country code vs. local format) to assess improvements in connection rates or user clarity.[6][5]

## Detailed SAP Onboarding Configuration Steps

Changing the manager phone number display format in SAP Onboarding typically involves:

1. Accessing the SAP SuccessFactors or SAP Onboarding email template management interface.
2. Identifying and editing the welcome message or new hire communication template.
3. Locating the placeholder variable for the manager's phone number, usually pulling from the HRIS or SAP Employee Profile.
4. Modifying the template to apply formatting functions either directly via template scripting or by calling external formatting services or SAP Business Rules.
5. Testing the template with sample data, confirming the display format includes international dialing codes and adheres to corporate privacy standards.
6. Deploying the updated template for use in live onboarding communications.
7. Optionally, implementing side-by-side extensibility via SAP Business Technology Platform to handle complex formatting or conditional visibility logic.

The latest SAP documentation advises coordination with SAP SuccessFactors administration teams and consulting SAP notes for any platform-specific instructions or updates.[7][1]

## Internal Communication & Training Strategy

To ensure consistent understanding and use of the updated phone number display in onboarding messages:

- HR teams should be informed via internal newsletters or meetings outlining the rationale and compliance considerations.
- Managers should receive direct communications clarifying the type of contact information shared, privacy controls, and expectations.
- Training sessions or documentation should be provided explaining how to update or restrict their contact info in HRIS if desired.
- New hires may receive updated onboarding guides explaining the contact info format and best ways to connect.

Clear documentation, FAQs, and support from HR technology teams help smooth adoption and reduce confusion.[8]

***

## Integration with Onboarding Workflows and Communication Channels

The manager phone number display change must align with overall onboarding workflows:

- Synchronization between HRIS, onboarding software, and communication platforms ensures accurate and consistent contact details.
- Automated data validation routines should be part of onboarding workflows to flag incomplete or invalid phone numbers.
- Integration with communication channels via APIs can enable clickable phone numbers or direct dial from portals.
- Compliance is maintained by embedding privacy checks and opt-in status into data flow processes.

This integrated approach prevents data silos, redundant updates, and potential compliance breaches.[10]
