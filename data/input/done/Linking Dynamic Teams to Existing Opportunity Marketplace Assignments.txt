## Fundamental Concepts and Technical Architecture of Dynamic Teams and Opportunity Marketplace

The SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace is a cloud-based talent mobility platform designed to empower employees to find internal growth opportunities such as projects, gigs, roles, mentoring, and learning pathways matching their skills, interests, and career goals. It operates by leveraging AI and machine learning to provide personalized recommendations, fostering internal mobility, skill development, and agile workforce creation.

Dynamic Teams within this context are flexible, skill-based groups created to address specific assignments or projects posted on the Opportunity Marketplace. These teams enable employees to collaborate on short-term gigs or developmental opportunities, going beyond traditional fixed organizational structures. This allows leveraging collective skills and fostering on-the-job learning.

Key components of this ecosystem:

- **Intelligent Skills Framework:** The backbone managing skill data, employee competencies, and matching logic.
- **Opportunity Marketplace Assignments:** Short-term roles, projects, or tasks posted for agile workforce engagement.
- **Dynamic Teams:** Groups formed dynamically based on the required skills and preferences to fulfill assignments.
- **AI Talent Matching:** Personalized linking of employees and teams to opportunities.
- **Integration with SAP SuccessFactors modules:** Such as Learning, Succession Planning, and Workforce Analytics.

Use cases typically include upskilling through real projects, internal gig matching, mentorship programs, and building agile teams to address timely organizational needs.[3][5][7][8][1]

## Operational Functioning of Dynamic Teams in the Opportunity Marketplace Context

Dynamic Teams form in direct relation to Opportunity Marketplace assignments. When an assignment is created, assignment owners can configure or link Dynamic Teams to source and manage employees interested or qualified for the opportunity. The operational flow includes:

- **Creation:** Assignment owners create an Opportunity Marketplace assignment with defined skill requirements.
- **Team Formation:** Dynamic Teams are dynamically created or linked to the assignment to pool and manage interested or matched employees.
- **Management:** Assignment owners oversee team membership, monitor progress, and handle collaboration within the Dynamic Team.
- **Interaction with Assignments:** Employees engage with assignments via their Dynamic Teams, collaborating to fulfill project goals or learning objectives.

Technical mechanisms enabling this include embedded UI elements in the Opportunity Marketplace for team linking, notifications, and management consoles. The underlying system relies on data synchronization between SuccessFactors modules and real-time AI-driven matchmaking algorithms. Role-based access controls ensure assignment owners have appropriate permissions to manage their teams.[5][9][1]

## Workflows and User Roles for Creating and Editing Assignments

The key workflows involve:

- **Assignment Creation:** Opportunity owners define assignment goals, required skills, duration, and visibility settings in the Opportunity Marketplace.
- **Editing:** Owners can update assignments to reflect changing needs or feedback.
- **Team Linking:** Owners link or create Dynamic Teams to operationalize assignment fulfillment.
- **Employee Interaction:** Team members apply for or are assigned to these opportunities; managers and owners track progress and outcomes.

User roles typically include:

- **Assignment Owner:** Creates, edits assignments, manages linked Dynamic Teams.
- **Team Owner:** Oversees Dynamic Team operations, member collaboration.
- **Employees:** Browse, apply for assignments via Dynamic Teams.
- **HR and Managers:** Monitor analytics, provide support and approvals.

Interaction between assignments and Dynamic Teams is crucial, with owners taking a central role in managing team composition and enabling agile workforce deployment.[9][3][5]
