## 1. Fundamental Concepts and Architecture of Role-Based Permissions Within the Growth Portfolio

The Growth Portfolio is a centralized repository within the SAP SuccessFactors Talent Intelligence Hub where employees store and manage role-specific and person-specific attributes. These attributes include skills, competencies, behaviors, and custom-defined attribute types. Role-based permissions govern who can view, edit, and manage these attributes, ensuring that sensitive talent data is only accessible by authorized stakeholders.

Administrators use the Manage Permission Roles tool in the Admin Center to assign specific permissions to roles targeting distinct population groups within the organization. Permissions include the ability to view or edit attribute types, attributes, and portfolio content. The architecture supports:

- **Granular permissions** on attributes and attribute types to control visibility and editability.
- Permissions scoped to **target populations**, enabling administrators to define which groups of employees can access particular attribute views.
- Attribute management is unified via an Attributes Library, ensuring consistent definitions across portfolios.
- Integration with artificial intelligence and machine learning to recommend skills and growth opportunities personalized for employees.
- Support for proficiency scales and tagging (core, critical, trending) that help contextualize attributes for talent management.

This role-based permission model is designed to balance flexibility with security, supporting both a global and localized talent strategy, including multi-lingual attribute definitions and translations. The architecture emphasizes centralized management by administrators while empowering employees to build and refine their personal growth portfolios within permitted boundaries.[1][3][5]

## 2. Functionalities for Setting Target Criteria for Desired Populations Before 1H 2025

Prior to 1H 2025, the Growth Portfolio featured a capability enabling administrators to set **target criteria**—specific attribute-based filters or rules controlling what attributes or attribute types certain population segments could see or interact with. These criteria allowed:

- Defining targeted access to attribute views based on attribute tags, roles, proficiency levels, or custom attribute types.
- Dynamic filtering ensuring populations only saw relevant portfolio attributes aligned with their roles or developmental aspirations.
- Administrative oversight that could enforce compliance and security by limiting exposure of sensitive talent data.
- The technical design relied on attribute tagging, population segmentation, and a permission rules engine embedded within the Talent Intelligence Hub framework.
- Target criteria could be configured via the Manage Permission Roles tool and linked to population filters based on organizational units, job roles, or other demographic filters.

This mechanism supported tailored talent management experiences, facilitating focused development programs and succession planning through secure, finely tuned portfolio views aligned to organizational strategy.[3][9][1]

## 3. Official Updates and Announcements on Removal of Target Criteria in 1H 2025

An extensive search of SAP SuccessFactors official release notes, product roadmaps, and administrative announcements confirms that as of 1H 2025, SAP deprecated the feature enabling administrators to set target criteria for attribute views within the Growth Portfolio. This removal was documented in:

- The 1H 2025 SAP SuccessFactors Release Paper and Talent Intelligence Hub update notes.
- Administrative center communications highlighting updated permission role configurations.

The stated or implied motivations for this removal include:

- **Technical Simplification:** To streamline the permission management framework by reducing redundant or complex filtering logic.
- **Security Enhancement:** To mitigate potential misconfigurations in attribute access controls that could lead to unintentional data exposure.
- **User Experience Improvement:** To provide a more consistent and predictable permission model that reduces administrative overhead.
- **Compliance Alignment:** To better align with evolving data protection regulations by tightening direct attribute access controls rather than indirect criteria-based filters.

SAP advised customers to adopt new permission models available post-1H 2025 that focus on direct attribute visibility settings rather than layered target criteria. The updates reinforce the emphasis on secure, transparent role-based permissions at the attribute level rather than rule-based population filtering.[10][3]

***

## 4. Current Role-Based Permission Settings Post-1H 2025 and Replacement Mechanisms

After the removal of target criteria for population attribute views, the Growth Portfolio’s role-based permission system now governs attribute visibility through more straightforward but granular controls:

- Permissions are assigned explicitly at the **attribute and attribute type level** for defined roles or populations without intermediary filters.
- Administrators control attribute view/edit rights directly, simplifying oversight and auditability.
- Alternative mechanisms include enhanced **tagging of attributes** (core, critical, trending) to categorize and manage access based on organizational importance.
- Populations are managed through fixed role assignments rather than dynamic criteria-based population filtering.
- Integration with SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace and Talent Intelligence Hub’s AI-driven recommendations remains intact, but attribute visibility is strictly governed by these explicit permissions.
- Broader administrative tools and reporting help monitor access and usage to ensure compliance and efficiency.

This model prioritizes clarity and security over flexible but complex targeting, with a focus on reducing administrative burden and potential misconfiguration risks.[1][3]

## 5. Implications of Permission Changes on Stakeholder Groups

The removal of target criteria and shift to direct attribute permissions impact key stakeholders as follows:

- **Administrators:** Reduced complexity in managing permissions but potentially less flexibility to target niche or dynamic population subsets. They benefit from clearer, more auditable permission frameworks, improving compliance oversight.
- **End Users:** Users might experience a more uniform attribute portfolio view, potentially losing some custom filtering benefits but gaining consistency.
- **HR and Talent Management Teams:** Streamlined talent review and development processes with less risk of accidental data exposure. However, tailored talent programs requiring specific attribute visibility may need adaptation or supplementary workflows.
- **Data Security Teams:** Enhanced confidence in permission controls reducing exposure risk, aligning better with privacy regulations and internal governance standards.
- **Overall Talent Management Efficiency:** Gains in usability and governance may compensate for reduced targeting granularity, supporting scalable and secure talent insights across the enterprise.

Stakeholders may need training and process updates to adapt to the new permission paradigms, but the changes are designed to provide a more robust foundation for growth portfolio data governance.[3][10]

## 6. Methodologies, Data Sources, and Security/Privacy Standards in Governing Role-Based Access

SAP Talent Intelligence Hub employs comprehensive governance methodologies including:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Users and administrators are assigned roles linked to explicit permissions on portfolio attributes and settings.
- **Attribute Tagging and Classification:** Attributes are categorized with tags that help define access and importance.
- **Data Localization and Translations:** Multi-language support ensures regional compliance.
- **Audit Logging:** All permission changes and attribute access events are tracked for security audits.
- **Compliance Alignment:** The system conforms to global privacy standards such as GDPR, leveraging SAP’s enterprise-grade security infrastructure.
- **Data Source Integrity:** Attributes are sourced from validated internal libraries, including migration from Job Profile Builder and Job Description Manager with integrity checks.
- **Technical Safeguards:** Encryption in transit and at rest, regular vulnerability assessments, and secure API integrations underpin data security frameworks.

This comprehensive approach balances accessibility with stringent protection of sensitive talent and growth data within the Growth Portfolio environment.[5][1][3]
