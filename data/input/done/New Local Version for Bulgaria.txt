To begin this extremely detailed and grounded report on the new local version for Bulgaria within SAP Employee Central Payroll, the first step is to gather information about the replication process of country/region-specific employee master data from Employee Central to Employee Central Payroll for Bulgaria, as a foundational aspect of understanding the technical and functional integration.

From a technical document on SF ECP Point-to-Point integration, the replication process involves the Employee Central Payroll system calling the Employee Central Compound Employee API to read employee master data and replicate it to Employee Central Payroll. The process is run by scheduling a report in Employee Central Payroll called RP_HRSFEC_PTP_EE_REPLICATION. This report calls queries to fetch the list of employee master data updated after a specific timestamp or marked for replication. The replication status is confirmed and logged, and errors are trackable in application logs (SLG1). There are configuration options such as filtering by pay groups to limit replication scope, data validation, and mapping check tools to validate consistency between systems. Push replication of Service Event Bus events (like Hire, Termination, Rehire) is used alongside point-to-point replication for efficient synchronization. Role-based permissions and API authentication are critical for secure and reliable integration.

This replication approach is designed to support country/region-specific scenarios, including Bulgaria, ensuring local payroll requirements are met by replicating region-specific data elements alongside global employee information.[1]
