## Overview of Legacy Learning Home Page Functionality, Architecture, and User Experience

The legacy Learning home page within SAP’s Learning platform served as the main gateway for enterprise users to access learning resources and manage learning activities. Its core functionalities and design reflected typical enterprise learning management system (LMS) needs:

- **Core Features:**
  - Access to curricula, courses, and learning plans.
  - Display of required learning assignments and progress tracking.
  - Quick navigation to legacy links such as My Orders, Approvals, Learning History, and Training Planner.
  - Role-based menus for managers, instructors, and administrators allowing access to team views, classes, and learning administration functions.
  - Basic bookmarking and collections management capabilities.
  - Support for viewing accomplishments and generating reports on learning progress.
  
- **Architecture and Integration:**
  - Based on SAP SuccessFactors Learning SaaS platform architecture.
  - Integrations included connection with SAP platform services for user authentication, data management, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.
  - It used legacy integration points with core SAP ecosystem components and third-party systems for content delivery and compliance tracking.
  
- **User Experience Design:**
  - The legacy home page had a more traditional, function-driven layout aimed at enterprise users familiar with SAP’s system.
  - It provided multiple links and menus, but with a less streamlined, less personalized interface compared to modern UX paradigms.
  - Users could toggle to the new Learning home page experience or stay on legacy via a visible switch.
  - Typical use cases involved employees checking mandatory training status, managers approving learning requests, and administrators managing course catalogs.

The legacy Learning home page was suitable for robust enterprise LMS requirements, especially in regulated industries and large corporations needing comprehensive training oversight and compliance tracking.[1][5]

## SAP’s Rationale for End of Maintenance and Deletion of Legacy Learning Home Page

SAP declared the legacy Learning home page End of Maintenance as of May 17, 2024, with a full deletion scheduled for November 15, 2025. Official documentation and communications indicate several key reasons:

- **Technical Reasons:**
  - The legacy platform used older architecture that limited scalability and flexibility.
  - SAP’s move to a modern, cloud-native architecture allowed better performance, enhanced security, and easier integration with AI-driven features.
  - Legacy codebase maintenance was costlier and slowed innovation.
  
- **Operational Reasons:**
  - Streamlining SAP’s learning solutions into a unified, future-proof platform reduced support complexity.
  - Enabling customers to benefit from new capabilities required consolidated focus on the new experience.
  
- **Security Reasons:**
  - Updated platforms incorporate enhanced security protocols and compliance with newer data protection regulations.
  - Legacy systems carry more vulnerabilities due to outdated components and architectures.
  
- **Business Reasons:**
  - The transition aligns with SAP’s broader move toward cloud transformation and modern user experiences.
  - It enables SAP to deliver AI-powered personalized learning and advanced analytics, which legacy systems could not readily support.
  
- **Official Communications:**
  - SAP SuccessFactors official release notes and deprecation notices articulate these reasons.
  - Administrators were advised through integrated admin portals and SAP help documents well ahead of these deadlines.[5][7][9]
