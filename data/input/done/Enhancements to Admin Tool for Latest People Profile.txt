## Detailed Report on Configure Latest People Profile Admin Tool in SAP Employee Central

### Functional Capabilities and Configuration Options

The newly designed **Configure Latest People Profile** admin tool enables administrators to configure the **Spotlight** (a quick-access panel displaying essential employee data cards) and **general People Profile settings** independently of the Full Profile activation status. This is a significant enhancement compared to previous tool versions that required enabling the Full Profile to access these configuration capabilities.

Key capabilities include:
- Configuration of Spotlight cards: showing or hiding cards, arranging them, and selecting which SuccessFactors application cards appear.
- Managing general profile settings such as:
  - Employee name pronunciation feature
  - “About Me” video feature
  - Display name format and employment differentiator choices
  - Background image management: assigning default images or allowing employees to choose from a curated library.
- Proxy management setup, allowing designated users to act on behalf of other employees in the profile context.
- AI-assisted writing tools integrated for better profile content creation.
- Preview functionality to review changes before making them live.

Configuring Spotlight and general settings no longer depends on activating the Full Profile, allowing more flexible and incremental adoption of the latest People Profile features.

Previously, the Full Profile had to be enabled to use this admin tool effectively, limiting organizations that wanted only partial profile enhancements. Now, two separate admin tools coexist when Full Profile is not enabled:
- The new **Configure Latest People Profile** tool for Spotlight and general settings.
- The legacy **Configure People Profile** tool to maintain legacy profile components.

This independent configurability supports phased implementation strategies and reduces the complexity linked with the full profile switch.

### Architecture and User Experience Design

The architecture of the latest People Profile in SAP Employee Central is modular and component-based, effectively decoupling Profile Preview, Spotlight, and Full Profile elements.

- **Spotlight:** A lightweight, configurable card-based overview panel that surfaces critical employee data quickly. It supports fast actions and essential insights without the overhead of the full profile.
- **General Settings:** Control profile display preferences and multimedia enhancements to personalize the employee experience.

The user experience is crafted such that Spotlight and Profile Preview are available to end users regardless of Full Profile activation, ensuring consistent and seamless access. The admin configuration tooling mirrors this architecture by separating configuration scopes to allow independent Spotlight and general settings management.

This design provides flexibility, enabling organizations to ramp up the profile experience gradually, improving usability and adoption without overwhelming HR and IT teams.
