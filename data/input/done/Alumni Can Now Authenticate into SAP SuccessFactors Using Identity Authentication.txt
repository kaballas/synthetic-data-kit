## 3. Traditional User Authentication and Alumni Access Challenges

Previously, authentication for SuccessFactors users post-employment was limited or non-existent due to:

- **Nature of Standard Provisioning:** User accounts tied tightly to employee HR status without an easy way to extend access beyond employment.
- **Security Concerns:** Risk of exposing sensitive HR or company material to former employees lacking current roles.
- **Access Management Limitations:** Lack of native mechanisms to provide fine-grained alumni access or differentiate external alumni from active employees.
- **Legacy Systems or Workarounds:** Companies resorted to disconnected portals or manual account provisioning for alumni, often fragmenting user experience.
- **Compliance and Control Issues:** Difficulty enforcing compliance rules and lifecycle management for users outside the core employee base (contextual inference and typical IAM challenges).[2]

***

## 4. New Functionality Introduced by SAP Identity Authentication for Alumni Access

The integration of SAP IAS introduces comprehensive capabilities enabling alumni users to securely access specific SuccessFactors company materials:

- **Technical Workflows:**
  - Alumni identities can be federated from external IdPs or maintained in SAP IAS cloud directory.
  - Authentication via SAML or OAuth tokens issued by IAS, validated by SuccessFactors.
  - Use of SSO allows smooth transition without multiple logins.
  - Lifecycle management automates onboarding and offboarding specifically tailored for alumni status.
- **User Experience Enhancements:**
