## Detailed Steps and Wizard-Like Guided Experiences of SBPA Templates for Onboarding and Crossboarding

SBPA templates enable highly configurable, wizard-like guided experiences within Work Zone that differ subtly between onboarding and crossboarding:

- **Onboarding Workflows**:
  - Welcome and orientation tasks (culture videos, company policy review)
  - Submission of personal and compliance documents (IDs, tax forms)
  - Manager-assigned buddy introductions and team meeting setups
  - Role-specific training enrollments and equipment provisioning
  - Automation of background checks and payroll setup
  
- **Crossboarding Workflows**:
  - Notification and acceptance of new internal position
  - Knowledge transfer plans from current to new role team
  - Updated compliance documents and consent forms where relevant
  - Training refreshers or upskilling based on new role requirements
  - Asset reassignment or new equipment provisioning

Each workflow uses **guided screens, validation rules, conditional branching, and task dependencies** configured in SBPA. The wizard ensures users only see relevant steps, enhancing clarity and minimizing errors. Key differences are that onboarding focuses on external hires integrating into the company, while crossboarding centers on internal transitions with knowledge transfer and role-specific updates.
