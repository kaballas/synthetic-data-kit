## General Features and Capabilities of SAP Analytics Cloud Story Reports in People Analytics

SAP Analytics Cloud Stories serve as interactive, presentation-style documents that combine data visualizations, charts, tables, text, and images for insights communication. They support multi-page reports providing a unified workplace for exploring, analyzing, and sharing data insights with drill-down and ad-hoc analysis capabilities. Story reports empower business users and analysts alike to create intuitive and self-service reports without extensive technical expertise. They come in two design modes: Classic and Optimized Design, the latter offering improved usability, performance, and integration for future enhancements.

In People Analytics, SAC Stories are used to visualize key HR metrics (such as talent acquisition, employee performance, retention rates, and engagement scores) by integrating diverse data sources like SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Datasphere, and more. The tool helps HR professionals identify trends and patterns from employee data, enabling strategic talent management decisions. Features enabling storytelling with rich text, multimedia, and guided narratives help communicate insights effectively to stakeholders, facilitating data-driven HR decisions.

SAC supports live connections for real-time data querying and import connections for data replication, allowing flexibility depending on the data volume and need for immediacy. Self-service capabilities also empower specialist HR teams to quickly build and share reports, supporting faster decision cycles and collaborative analytics.[1][3][5]
