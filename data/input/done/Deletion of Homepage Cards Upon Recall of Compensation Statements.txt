The search results delivered partial insights on SAP Compensation and Variable Pay modules, especially on lifecycle management of Rewards Statements, compensation plan templates, and mention of homepage cards in relation to statement recalls. However, explicit, deeply technical details on architecture, system events governing homepage cards, and synchronization intricacies are not fully detailed in these top-level hits.

I will now refine the search to gather information on:
- Definitions and technical architecture of Homepage Cards within SAP Compensation (to complement what was found for Reward Statements).
- The lifecycle and recall mechanisms of Rewards Statements in SAP Compensation.
- How homepage cards are deleted, hidden, or synchronized with statement recalls.
- SAP documentation or community knowledge on roles, permissions, and logging related to these processes.
- Known issues or best practices reported around these functions.
