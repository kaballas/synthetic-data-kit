## 1. Pre-Change Activation and Authentication Mechanisms in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Apps

### Activation Methods

Prior to recent changes, SAP SuccessFactors Mobile apps supported four key methods for activation:

- **Search-Based Activation:** Users enter company name, ID, or URL to locate their instance.  
- **Email-Based Activation:** Activation links sent via email.  
- **MDM-Based Activation:** Mobile Device Management pushes key-value pairs to control app activation, restricting device access where necessary.  
- **QR Code Activation:** Users scan a QR code to associate their app with an SAP SuccessFactors instance.[1]

### Authentication and Identity Verification

- **Login via Company's Identity Provider:** Activation hands off to the company's SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) identity provider (IdP) for authentication. After successful login via web browser SAML flow, the app is activated.

- **Passwords & Biometrics:** The app enforced company-defined password policies, requiring users to select passwords meeting criteria, with forced updates if policies changed. Device biometrics (iOS Touch ID, Face ID, Android fingerprint) could optionally supplement or replace password entry, but biometrics were user-choice options, not mandatory.[1]

- **OAuth Tokens Post-Activation:** After activation and authentication, OAuth access and refresh tokens are issued to the app to maintain session continuity, reducing repeated logins until tokens expire or are revoked.[7]

- **Managed Device Enforcement:** When restricted to managed devices, non-managed devices were prevented from activating or using the app, with immediate app profile deletion on mismatched devices.[1]

### Role in Security and Identity Verification

These mechanisms collectively ensured that:

- User identity was verified using corporate IdP and enforced password policies.  
- Device-level policies could restrict app use to managed and compliant devices.  
- Biometric authentication enhanced user convenience without compromising security.  
- OAuth tokens enabled secure token-based session management post authentication.

## 2. Detailed Technical Updates in Recent Changes (Focused on iOS and Multi-User Scenarios)

### Mandatory Reauthentication on iOS

- **Account Transition:** The iOS app transitioned from the "SuccessFactors, Inc." Apple account to the official "SAP SE" account.

- **Mandatory Sign-In Post-Update:** All iOS users must sign in again after updating due to account transfer, to establish a new secure session.[3]

### Multi-Profile Mode Enhancements

- **Unified Company/Instance Requirement:** All profiles on a device must now belong to the same company/instance as the owner (first activated user), invalidating profiles from other companies or instances.

- **Elimination of Profile Nicknames:** Nicknames previously allowed for profiles were removed; profile display now shows the owner profile beneath the user's name for clarity.

- **Restricted Profile Removal:** Only the individual user or the owner can remove a profile, requiring owners to use Settings > Manage Profiles for deletion; profiles can no longer be deleted directly from the profile list screen.

- **Removal of Shared Device Setting:** The legacy “Shared Device” toggle is discontinued; features it supported (e.g., passcode requirements) are now automatically applied when multiple profiles are active.

- **Android Profile Switcher Removal:** Android users must end a session before another user can log in, aligning with iOS workflows and improving session security.[3]

### Additional Authentication Adjustments

- **Improved Activation Security:** The activation process was enhanced to be more restrictive, ensuring that profiles cannot coexist with mismatched company instances, reducing risk of unauthorized profile presence.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement:** The app now fully inherits MFA protocols from the SAP SuccessFactors web application, strengthening identity proofing during app access.[1]

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Activation on iOS**          | Optional re-login unless password policy changes | Mandatory reauthentication post-update due to app account move [3][5] |
| **Profile Management**         | Nicknames allowed; Shared Device setting present | Nicknames removed; "Shared Device" setting removed; owner/restricted profile removal only [3] |
| **Multi-User Device Handling** | Allowed mixed company profiles; easier profile switching on Android | Single company/instance for profiles; Android session must end before switching; profile removal controls tightened [3] |
| **Authentication Factors**     | Password + optional biometrics                    | MFA fully enforced; OAuth tokens continue; stricter session control [1][3] |
| **Security Enforcement**       | Managed device enforcement optional; less synced across profiles | Automated enforced security settings on multi-profile mode; uniform company instance enforcement [1][3] |
| **User Experience (UX)**       | Potential profile confusion with nicknames and shared device options | Clearer profile ownership, stricter session control, potential for more sign-ins but higher security [3] |

Functionally, the new system enforces tighter restrictions around profile and company association, and streamlines session management for multi-user devices. Security-wise, these updates reduce risks of unauthorized access through shared device loopholes or profile bypasses.

***

## 4. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Principles and Standards Applied or Enhanced

The updated SAP SuccessFactors Mobile apps exemplify the application of several leading IAM principles aligned with mobile enterprise best practices:

- **Strong Authentication & MFA:** Enforcing company-wide MFA inherited from web SSO, bolstered by device biometrics when user-enabled, aligning with NIST digital identity guidelines.

- **Device Trust & Management:** Use of managed device restrictions, roaming OAuth tokens, and app profile deletion on non-compliant devices emphasizes device trust and compliance, a critical part of Zero Trust security models.

- **Least Privilege & Segregation:** Restriction of profiles to a single company/instance and limiting profile deletion rights ensures access control aligned with principle of least privilege.

- **Session Management:** Use of OAuth tokens and session termination requirements before profile switches help mitigate session hijacking risks and unauthorized use in multi-user contexts.

- **User Accountability:** Profile management tied to single owner users ensures accountability and traceability, reducing risk of orphan or rogue profiles.

- **Security by Design:** Removal of ambiguous features (like nicknames and shared device toggle) reduces attack surface and user confusion, embodying secure design principles.[3][1]

These align with industry IAM standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800-63B, and common enterprise mobile security frameworks, particularly those used in regulated HR and enterprise environments.
