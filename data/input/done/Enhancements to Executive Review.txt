## Current Functionality and Configuration of Executive Review in Calibration

The Executive Review feature within SAP’s Calibration module in Performance & Goals is designed as a high-level oversight tool primarily for senior HR and executive roles. Its core purpose is to provide an aggregated, graphical summary of calibration sessions, enabling review of calibration outcomes across teams, departments, or the entire organization. This summary supports key decision-making and standardization in performance management.

### User Roles and Permissions

- **Executive Review Users**: Only users with explicitly assigned special permissions can access the Executive Review interface. These are typically HR leaders, executives, or calibration owners with a role-based permission (RBP) enabling "Executive Review" access.
- **Facilitator**: Manages the calibration session workflow, sets up calibration templates, creates sessions, and monitors progress.
- **Participants/Managers**: Contribute inputs and ratings during calibration for their direct reports.
- **Subjects**: Employees undergoing calibration evaluation.
- **Calibration Owner**: Oversees the entire calibration cycle and ensures completion.

Role-Based Permissions are crucial in SAP PMGM, controlling access to calibration templates, data, and workflow steps. Executive Review access is segregated to maintain security and data integrity.

### Workflow and Data Inputs

The Calibration process consists of these high-level steps:
1. **Setup & Template Configuration**: Templates define the calibration scope (performance, compensation, talent flags) and data sources (goal plans, performance forms).
2. **Subject and Participant Assignment**: Employees (subjects) and their managers (participants) are linked to calibration sessions, often based on organizational reporting structures.
3. **Calibration Execution**: Managers submit ratings and talent flags which facilitators and calibration owners review.
4. **Executive Review Access**: Executives and HR leaders use Executive Review to analyze aggregated calibration data visually and make final adjustments or approvals.

Data inputs include finalized performance ratings, compensation recommendations, and talent indicators gathered from integrated Performance & Goals modules, talent management forms, and compensation plans.

The Executive Review interface presents:
- Aggregated graphical summaries (distribution curves, ratings histograms).
- Session progress tracking.
- Filters by department, job role, or performance segments.
- Access to drill-down details on individual calibration sessions and participants.

This consolidated view facilitates standardized calibration across an organization, promoting equitable talent decisions.

## Recent Enhancements to Executive Review in Calibration (Technical, UI, Workflow)

Recent updates documented in late 2024 and early 2025 releases include:

- **Expanded Role-Based Permissions**: Introduction of finer-grained RBP roles that allow more tailored access to Executive Review features, including view/edit rights based on target population relationships.
- **Enhanced UI Dashboards**: Improved visualization tools within Executive Review featuring customizable graphs, color-coded alerts for rating anomalies, and side-by-side views of multiple calibration sessions.
- **Real-Time Session Updates**: Workflow improvements now allow near real-time updating of session progress visible to Executive Review users, reducing lag and manual refreshes.
- **Integration of Compensation Data**: Deeper integration with Compensation Management allows executives to see salary adjustment recommendations alongside performance ratings in Executive Review.
- **New Filtering and Search Capabilities**: Users can filter executive summaries by additional parameters such as job function, grade band, and calibration status.
- **Automated Alerts and Notifications**: The system now sends executive users automated notifications for sessions at risk of delay or imbalance in ratings distribution.

These changes make the Executive Review more interactive, data-rich, and actionable, with technical backend improvements ensuring faster data processing and seamless integration with other SAP SuccessFactors modules.

## Challenges in Previous Versions and Enhancements Addressing Them

### Past Pain Points

- Static and less interactive dashboards limited real-time insights.
- Insufficient granularity in role permissions risked either overexposure or restricted access.
- Calibration data sometimes lagged behind in session updates, impairing timely interventions.
- Limited integration with compensation data reduced calibration decision context.
- Manual session and participant management increased facilitator workload.

### How Enhancements Address These

- Real-time updates and interactive UI resolve delays and improve insights.
- Expanded RBP roles provide nuanced access control.
- Compensation integration provides a more comprehensive decision-making context.
- Automation and alerts reduce manual tracking and supervision.

Remaining limitations may include dependency on accurate data input upstream and the need for ongoing user training on new functionalities.
