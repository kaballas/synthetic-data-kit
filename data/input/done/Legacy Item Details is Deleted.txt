## 1. Legacy Item Details Experience in SAP Learning

The "legacy Item Details experience" was the traditional interface and functionality set within SAP SuccessFactors Learning that allowed users—learners and administrators—to view detailed information for individual learning items, such as courses, curricula, and programs. Core functionalities included:

- Display of essential learning item metadata such as title, description, category, and classifications.
- Viewing of item-specific details like schedules, location, price, prerequisites, and attachments.
- Access to tabs for various aspects of the learning item, including Overview, Enrollments, Documents, and possibly evaluations.
- User interface elements comprised header tabs along the top of the detail page, tiles or sections displaying item attributes, and action buttons for enrollment or registration.
- It provided a centralized place for learners to review course specifics before enrolling and for administrators to manage item attributes.
- Specific use cases included learners selecting courses by browsing item details; admins assigning learning items; managing schedules and class registrations; and viewing learning item performance or completion data.

Technically, it was built on older UI paradigms, reliant on classic navigation and layout within SuccessFactors Learning Administration and user-facing portals. It integrated with Learning Programs, Curricula, and Class Management modules allowing for objects to be bundled and tracked.[1][5][8][9]

## 2. Official Announcements, Documentation, and Support Notes

An official SAP release note dated May 15, 2025, formally declared the deletion of the legacy Item Details experience effective May 16, 2025. Key points include:

- The legacy Item Details experience was fully deprecated and removed from the system on that date.
- The new Course Home experience had been introduced earlier (starting from the 2H 2023 release) as a replacement, with phased enablement and feature parity goals.
- The replacement was aimed to improve navigation, discoverability, and integrated access to learning item information.
- SAP's support notes indicated that any customer still using legacy views needed to transition to the new experience before the cutoff to avoid disruptions.
- Reasons cited for deletion included modernization of the Learning UI, enhanced user experience, mobile-optimized interfaces, and consolidation of features into a single streamlined environment.[5][7]

Further documentation on the new experience referenced integrated learning settings controlling behavior and display preferences relevant to the new UI.[10]

## 3. Key Differences Between Legacy and New Item Details Functionalities

The transition from legacy Item Details to the new Course Home experience brought several notable changes:

| Aspect                        | Legacy Item Details                         | New Course Home Experience                   |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| UI Layout                    | Tabbed header navigation with discrete sections for item info. | Tiles and card-based UI emphasizing at-a-glance info. |
| Search & Discoverability      | Search limited by category or course name. | Enhanced Browse Library with richer filters, optional curricula visibility. |
| Enrollment Actions           | Buttons located within detail tabs.         | Streamlined enrollment integrated into card actions. |
| Mobile Accessibility          | Less optimized for mobile devices.          | Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop. |
| Integration                  | Required multiple navigation steps to access related Learning components. | Unified access to curricula and learning paths directly. |
| User Experience              | Traditional, somewhat dated interface causing navigation friction. | Modern, visually appealing, simpler user flows. |
| Performance & Loading        | Heavier pages due to older UI framework.   | Improved performance with refreshed technology stack. |

The new experience also supports features like optional curricula in the main learning interface and richer team view reporting for managers, improving overall engagement and administrative oversight.[3][7][9][10]
