## Deep Research Report on Clock-Time Users and Partial-Day Absences in SAP Time Tracking Systems

### Fundamental Time Tracking and Absence Management Concepts for Clock-Time Users

Clock-time users are employees whose working hours are tracked based on specific clock-in and clock-out times, rather than on a fixed schedule or estimated hours. The fundamental concepts relevant to clock-time users in workplace time management systems include:

- **Clock-Time Recording**: Employees record their actual start and end times each workday, capturing exact hours worked. This precise time recording supports accurate payroll, attendance, and compliance.
- **Absence Management**: Absences are managed by recording the time employees do not work within their scheduled shift, either as full-day or partial-day absences.
- **Partial-Day Absences**: These are absences that cover a part of the scheduled working hours, such as half-day or custom hours off within a workday.
- **Time Types and Units**: Time can be tracked in units of hours or days, with specific configurations governing whether partial-day absences are allowed and how they are recorded.
- **Break Time Handling**: Break times (fixed or dynamic) affect how start and end times translate into payable working hours.
- **Integration With HR and Payroll**: Time tracking data must integrate seamlessly with payroll and HR systems to ensure accurate compensation and compliance with labor laws.

Traditionally, clock-time is recorded either through physical or digital time clocks, biometric systems, or employee self-reporting via timesheets or digital interfaces. This data feeds into time management software that calculates worked hours, absences, paid time off, and other attendance-related metrics.

### Existing Functionalities and Limitations in SAP Time Tracking for Partial-Day Absences

SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking and comparable systems offer functionalities for recording partial-day absences, but with some constraints:

- Employees can request absences in partial units such as half-days or custom start and end times.
- The system usually requires entry of start and end times for partial-day absences, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.
- SAP supports half-day absences configured via the "Absence Duration" field, allowing users to select full day, first half-day, second half-day, or custom durations.
- Limitations include:
  - Inflexibility in manually entered times causing complexity in calculating exact half-day durations, especially with breaks.
  - Certain absence types or configurations restrict absence requests to full days only.
  - The system rounds times since it doesn't store seconds, causing minor discrepancies.
  - Complex break rules make manual entry prone to mistakes and user frustration.
- Absence recording can be set according to calendar days or work schedule, affecting how durations are displayed and calculated.

### Definitions and UI Design Patterns for Half-Day Absences Across Systems

Half-day absences are typically defined as an absence lasting one-half of the total planned working hours in a day. Implementation varies:

- Some systems let users select a "First Half" or "Second Half" of a day, automatically computing the precise start and end times.
- Others require manual time entry of start and end times, increasing user effort.
- Common UI elements include toggles, dropdowns, or radio buttons to choose full day, first half-day, second half-day, or custom durations.
- Some systems use checkboxes for predefined half-day selections without revealing time fields.
- "Custom Duration" options allow users to specify exact clock-in/out times for flexibility.
- Disabled manual entry for half-day options reduces input errors and improves usability.

SAP SuccessFactors recently introduced a UI enhancement enabling clock-time users to select "first half" or "second half" days directly, with start and end times calculated automatically and locked to read-only, representing a modern UI design best practice.

### Technical and Operational Challenges in Half-Day Absence Selection by Half-Day Options

Allowing clock-time users to select half-day absences by simply choosing “first half” or “second half” introduces multiple challenges:

- **Payroll Calculations**: Half-day selections must correctly translate into payroll hours, accounting for breaks and rounding, ensuring accurate wage calculations.
- **Compliance**: Labor laws may require precise tracking of worked hours vs. absences, necessitating accurate start/end times even if user input is simplified.
- **Integration with HR Modules**: Absence data feeds into leave management, benefits accrual, and reporting modules, so half-day classifications must be consistent across systems.
- **Work Schedule Variability**: Different shifts or flexible work schedules complicate automatic determination of half-day times.
- **Break Accounting**: Fixed vs. dynamic breaks impact how half-days are timed; system logic must account for whether breaks belong to the first or second half.
- **Data Storage and API Support**: Backend data models must support absence day classifications ("FIRST_HALF", "SECOND_HALF") and calculated start/end times.
- **User Confusion and Error Prevention**: The UI must clearly communicate how half-days are calculated to prevent misunderstandings.
- **Edge Cases Handling**: Requests spanning holidays, overlapping absences, or non-working days require careful logic to avoid incorrect time deductions.

### Guidance and Best Practices from SAP and HR Tech Industry

SAP and broader HR tech industry recommend these standards for handling half-day absences:

- Use clear absence duration classifications (e.g., full day, first half, second half) and avoid forcing manual clock entry for half-days.
- Support configurable rounding rules and break handling to align with company policies and labor laws.
- Ensure UI simplicity to reduce user input errors: provide selection options rather than time fields for common half-day requests.
- Enable recalculation and edits by administrators with audit trails.
- Integrate absence day classifications with API endpoints for easy data interchange and reporting.
- Follow SAP SuccessFactors recommended object configurations such as enabling `requestingWithAbsenceDayClassification` and `absenceDayClassification` editable fields.
- Incorporate training materials and support documentation to guide users on half-day absence requests.
- Implement proper validation to handle non-working days, multiple-day requests, and leave types that disallow partial days.

### User Behavior, Error Rates, and Administrative Overhead Data

While specific empirical data on error rates and administrative overhead before and after UI enhancements is sparse publicly, general observations from SAP documentation and HR tech analyses reveal:

- Manual start/end time entry for partial absences is a frequent source of user error.
- Simplified UI options for half-days reduce data entry time and mistake frequency.
- The administrative burden decreases when absence requests auto-generate exact clock times.
- User satisfaction improves with intuitive absence request options.
- Error reduction leads to fewer payroll corrections and compliance issues.

### Comparison of New Functionality with Previous Workflows
