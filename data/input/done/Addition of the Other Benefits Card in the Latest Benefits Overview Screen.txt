The research involves a very deep and extensive investigation across multiple aspects of SAP Employee Central Global Benefits, focusing heavily on the newly added "Other Benefits" card in the Benefits Overview screen. Below is an extremely detailed and grounded report covering each question extensively with the most relevant and current information sourced from up-to-date SAP documentation, product updates, and best practices.

***

## 1. Current Functionalities, Layout, and Data Sources of Benefits Overview Screen in SAP Employee Central Global Benefits

The existing Benefits Overview screen within SAP Employee Central Global Benefits serves as a centralized employee self-service portal to view, manage, and enroll in benefits. It typically includes multiple cards or sections representing different categories of benefits. The main functionalities include:

- **Benefits Summary:** Displays a consolidated overview of benefits that employees are enrolled in or eligible for, such as insurance plans, pensions, and savings plans.
- **Enrollment Management:** Allows employees to enroll in benefit programs or individual benefit offerings.
- **Claims Management:** Displays claims related to benefits (e.g., dental visits) and allows submissions within configured workflows.
- **Benefit Confirmation Statement:** Provides a downloadable, printable consolidated statement summarizing employee and employer contributions and plan details.
- **Help and Resources:** A section for helpful links configured by administrators for benefit guidance.

The layout consists of multiple "benefit cards," each representing a set of benefits like insurance, pension, savings plans, and other categories. These cards provide action links for enrollment, claim management, or viewing detailed statements.

Data sources feeding this screen typically include integrated backend HR and benefits databases, including data from SAP Global Benefits configuration, third-party plan providers, and employee profile data stored in Employee Central. Data is aggregated and displayed dynamically in the employee portal UI.

Employees can typically access the screen from the Employee Files menu by selecting Employee Benefits or from a quick action menu (e.g., Manage My Benefits).

Typical benefit cards include:
- Insurance (medical, dental, life)
- Pension schemes
- Savings plans
- Claims and reimbursements
- Enrollment programs

This structure allows streamlined benefit management within a single interface tailored to each employee's eligibility and region.[1][3][5]

## 2. Definition and Categorization of "Other Benefits" Across Global HR and Benefits Platforms

The "Other Benefits" category is generally a catch-all category used to group benefit types that do not fall under the primary, standardized categories like insurance or pensions. Across SAP Employee Central and comparable HR platforms, "Other Benefits" typically include:

- Non-traditional or non-mandatory benefits (e.g., wellness programs, employee discounts, commuting assistance)
- Flexible benefits (cafeteria plans allow choice among various small-scale benefits)
- Employee perks such as gym memberships, educational assistance, or childcare support
- Unique local or global benefits that don't fit established categories

This category is defined variably but is intended to ensure comprehensive coverage of all benefit types employees receive that may not be part of core benefits schemes.

Within SAP Employee Central, "Other Benefits" may be configured by clients as additional cards or fields using custom objects, extensions, or integration with external systems to reflect these varied benefit types. In broader HRIS systems, the label "Other Benefits" helps aggregate details critical to employee engagement but challenging to fit in standard benefit schema.[7][1]
