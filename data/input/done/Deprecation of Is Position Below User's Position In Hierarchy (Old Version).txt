***

## Definition, Functionality, and Use Cases of the Old Rule Function

The "Position Below User's Position in Hierarchy" rule function (old version) in SAP Employee Central was designed to determine whether a given position exists within a user's organizational hierarchy and specifically if it is below the user's own position. This rule function was primarily used in Position Management scenarios to enforce hierarchical restrictions and validations.

Key functionalities:
- Evaluate if a position is subordinate to the user's position in the org hierarchy.
- Used in security and permission role configurations to restrict actions such as viewing or creating positions only below the user's own position.
- Supported enforcement in workflows and business rules to prevent unauthorized changes above the user's position level.

Use cases included:
- Restricting managers from creating or modifying only those positions under their hierarchy span.
- Controlling visibility and access within the Position object based on hierarchical levels.
- Business process validations ensuring workflow submissions and approvals align with org structure.

Its scope covered position-based organizational hierarchies orchestrated through Position Management in Employee Central. Technically, it leveraged foundation objects of Position and employed timestamp-based querying to check the hierarchy as of a certain date.

The architecture integrated with the underlying data model of Positions and incumbents, utilizing SAP’s business rules engine to execute hierarchical checks during runtime validations or access permissions.[1][5][9]

## Features, Behaviors, and Limitations Compared to Other Hierarchy Rule Functions

The old rule function:
- Focused exclusively on position hierarchies rather than matrix or job-based relationships.
- Was limited to checking "below user" position relation only; it did not support more granular hierarchy types or multiple hierarchies.
- Was synchronous and tightly coupled with Position Management foundation objects.
- Validated permissions at the point of save or workflow submission but did not offer complex scenarios like indirect matrix relations or dynamic date-range filters.

Compared to newer or alternative rule functions like the "Position Below User's Position In Hierarchy (New Version)":
- The old version lacked support for multiple hierarchy types (e.g., matrix or dotted-line reporting).
- Newer versions provided more flexibility with configurable parameters, better performance, and supported cross-module integration.
- The old function’s implementation was harder to extend or customize due to rigid architecture.
- Limitations also included less detailed output (binary true/false) with no additional metadata for decision support.[3][9][1]

## SAP Official Documentation and EoD Announcement on May 15, 2025

SAP’s official announcement dated May 15, 2025, declared the End of Development (EoD) for the old version of the "Position Below User's Position In Hierarchy" rule function. The documentation outlined:
- The planned removal of this old function in the first half of 2026.
- The rationale focusing on modernization of the Employee Central platform and improving flexibility via new, enhanced rule functions.
- Emphasis on driving uniformity across cloud applications by retiring legacy components.
- Guidance for customers to begin transition planning immediately.
- Documentation was provided via SAP Help Portal under deprecation notices and in roadmap communications targeting the Company Organization domain.[8][10]

***

## Planned Changes and Replacement Functionalities in 1H 2026

SAP will introduce a replacement set of rule functions in early 2026 to fully substitute the deprecated old function. Planned enhancements include:
- A new rule function supporting multiple hierarchy types (position, matrix, job) with configurable filters.
- Ability to check hierarchical relations with more granular control, such as indirect reports or selective hierarchy traversal.
- Improved API integration for easier embedding into workflows and extensions.
- Performance optimizations and more detailed output for advanced decision-making.
- These new rule functions align with SAP's strategic roadmap targeting flexible, enterprise-wide organizational management.[7][10][8]

***

## Deprecation Timeline within SAP’s Product Lifecycle Strategy

The deprecation fits SAP’s broader lifecycle management by:
- Phasing out legacy, less flexible rule functions to reduce maintenance overhead.
- Aligning Employee Central’s Company Organization capabilities with NextGen cloud architecture.
- Supporting innovation by enabling enhanced use cases involving complex organizational relationships.
- Consolidating validation and permission mechanisms under unified, modern rule libraries.
- Ensuring compatibility with evolving integration and workflow standards.[10][8]

***

## Migration Paths, Best Practices, and Available Tools

SAP recommends a structured migration approach including:
- Comprehensive audit of existing workflows, permissions, and business rules relying on the old function.
- Parallel testing of new rule functions in sandbox environments.
- Use of SAP’s migration documentation and best practice guides detailing equivalence mappings.
- Employ SAP’s built-in tooling to detect deprecated function usage and flag dependencies.
- Scheduled updates aligned with patch and release cycles to minimize operational disruption.[8][10]

Best practices:
- Maintain detailed documentation of existing configurations.
- Incrementally replace old function calls with new APIs.
- Engage SAP support and partners for complex customizations.
- Train administrators and developers on new function capabilities.[5][10]

***

## Impact on Existing Workflows, Configurations, and Risks

Removing the old rule function can impact:
- Any workflow approvals or validations that check position hierarchy using this rule.
- Permission roles restricting creation or modification of positions below user’s level.
- Custom business rules that embed this function for conditional logic.

Risks include:
- Workflow failures or unauthorized access if migration isn’t complete.
- Operational disruptions during transition phases.
- Potential data inconsistencies if legacy logic is not fully aligned with new implementations.

SAP advises risk mitigation by early testing, fallback plans, and staged migration over several release cycles.[10][8]

***

## User and Partner Reactions

Community feedback has surfaced in SAP forums and partners’ blogs:
- Concerns about migration effort due to embedded legacy usage.
- Requests for tooling to simplify dependency analysis.
- Recognition of benefits from new function flexibility.
- Emergence of workaround solutions to bridge gaps during transition.
- Calls for extended support timelines to accommodate large enterprise customers.

SAP continues engagement with this feedback for refining messaging and providing expanded support.[8][10]

## Strategic Advisory for Organizations Using the Old Rule Function

1. **Phase 1 – Assessment**
   - Perform a full inventory of where the old rule function is used (workflows, rules, permissions).
   - Document business processes dependent on hierarchical validations.

2. **Phase 2 – Planning**
   - Identify equivalent new rule functions.
   - Define migration timeline aligned with SAP’s 1H 2026 removal date.
   - Develop risk mitigation strategies including fallback and manual overrides.

3. **Phase 3 – Testing**
   - Implement new rule functions in non-production environments.
   - Validate behavior against legacy outputs.
   - Engage key stakeholders in UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

4. **Phase 4 – Migration**
   - Gradually phase out old rule function in production.
   - Monitor workflows and permissions closely.
   - Use SAP diagnostic tools to detect any residual usage.

5. **Phase 5 – Optimization**
   - Leverage new function capabilities for process enhancement.
   - Update documentation and train support teams.
   - Incorporate organizational inputs to fine-tune hierarchies.

This phased approach ensures operational continuity, reduces risks, and capitalizes on operational efficiencies through modernization.[10][8]
