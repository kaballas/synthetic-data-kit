## Pixel Perfect Talent Card (PPTC) Overview in SAP Employee Central and People Analytics

The Pixel Perfect Talent Card (PPTC) is a customizable, visually enhanced talent profile feature within SAP SuccessFactors. It primarily serves as a one-page, visually appealing digital report of an individual employee’s key talent metrics, such as performance ratings, goal achievements, competencies, succession planning data, and talent flags. It is often used by succession planners, talent reviewers, and line managers to make informed decisions quickly.

PPTC integration is tightly linked with Employee Profile and Talent Management modules of SAP SuccessFactors, leveraging real-time data through an XML-based template configuration (scorecard.xml). It uses the open-source BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools) framework to design and generate these reports. The cards can be executed directly from the employee profile or via quick action cards and support flexible layouts controlled by role-based permissions. They can be viewed onscreen or generated as PDF reports.

Although well integrated with Employee Profile and Performance Management data, PPTC has limited access to broader data sources such as Employee Central’s core HR data or Learning Management System data. This specialized focus provides a high degree of customizability for talent review scenarios but at the expense of requiring dedicated BIRT expertise for implementation and maintenance.[5][10][1][3]

***

## Original Rationale and Timeline for Planned EOM and Deletion (November 15, 2025)

SAP originally planned to end maintenance and delete PPTC by November 15, 2025. The rationale centered on the technology becoming outdated, with limited enhancements in recent years, resulting in increasing maintenance complexity and reduced strategic alignment with SAP’s future analytics platform vision.

Key motivations included simplifying the product portfolio and steering customers towards modern, cloud-native analytics solutions offered through the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). These newer tools provide more comprehensive integration capabilities, adaptable data visualizations, and scalable architecture compatible with SAP’s evolving Employee Central and People Analytics ecosystem.

The timeline aligned with a formal notification period allowing customers time to migrate to alternate solutions. SAP emphasized the need for a transition to ensure long-term analytics continuity and agility.[3][5]

***

## Reasons Behind SAP’s Withdrawal of the Deprecation Announcement

SAP withdrew the planned deprecation primarily due to strong customer feedback highlighting continued heavy reliance on PPTC for critical talent review processes. Customers pointed out the absence of a fully equivalent replacement that matches PPTC’s unique blend of customization, design control, and tight Employee Profile integration.

Technical considerations also played a role; migrating complex BIRT templates and configurations to modern tools presented non-trivial challenges and potential disruption risks.

The decision reflects SAP’s responsiveness to customer needs and operational realities, balancing modernization efforts with support for existing investments. It showcases appreciation for the strategic value customers derive from PPTC, despite its older technology base.[1][5][3]
