Starting to address the user's query methodically based on the earliest relevant results:

1. The technical and functional capabilities of SAP SuccessFactors Mobile in handling multiple employments per user prior to employment switching appear limited, with a known product limitation such that the mobile app did not support concurrent employment or global assignment features before 2H 2025. This meant employees with multiple employment records could not switch between employments via the mobile app, nor could they select or view other employment profiles within the app.[1]

2. SAP SuccessFactors defines multiple active employments within Employee Central by creating multiple EmpEmployment and User entities linked to the same Person entity. Employment records are structured separately, usually differentiated by attributes like assignmentClass (e.g., "ST" for standard jobs). Organizational scenarios necessitating switching include worker conversion (full-time to contractor or vice versa), rehiring with existing profiles, and concurrent multiple jobs per employee. Use cases comprise employees with global assignments or multiple roles needing distinct data visibility and action capabilities.[3][9]

3. For enabling switching between multiple active employments in the mobile app, SAP SuccessFactors introduced this feature around or after the 2H 2025 release. The workflow includes a UI mechanism allowing employees and managers to select among their active employments. Security protocols are designed to ensure identity and access rights management across employments, maintaining role-based access control per employment record. Data synchronization mechanisms ensure employment-specific data like profiles, org charts, and reviews update real-time in the app. However, detailed specifics of UI elements and backend mechanisms remain limited in available public documentation.[7][1]

4. Switching active employments in the mobile app enables or restricts access to employment-specific features such as the Organizational Chart and 360-degree Reviews, allowing accurate context and data retrieval pertinent to the selected employment record. Backend integration points include the Employee Central data service layers, which provision updated employment entity data, synchronized with mobile UI and stored locally for performance. Performance considerations focus on minimizing sync latency, securing data during transitions, and maintaining seamless user experience when switching employment contexts.[7]

5. Methodological recommendations by SAP and industry experts focus on aligning the multiple employment handling and switching feature with mobile UX/UI design principles by offering intuitive employment switching UIs, minimizing cognitive load, ensuring data consistency, and optimizing for bandwidth and security compliance (e.g., GDPR, local data protection laws). Best practices include robust identity verification, clear employment labeling in UI, and seamless backend data flow.[1][7]

6. Common challenges reported include technical limitations in early mobile app versions lacking the employment switching feature, synchronization errors, security concerns over cross-employment data visibility, and UX issues causing user confusion. Solutions involve software updates aligned with SAP SuccessFactors release roadmaps, configuring provisioning to correctly map multiple employments, and training users on switching workflows. Workarounds include accessing certain data via desktop portals or isolated app modules before mobile support matures.[1][7]

7. Comparatively, the SAP SuccessFactors Mobile employment switching feature's introduction puts it in parity with some competitors in HR mobile apps offering multi-employment management. Functionality, user experience, integration complexity, and scalability benefit from SAP's enterprise platform backbone but may lag behind niche mobile-first HR systems optimized for multi-employment from inception. SAP's advantage is strong backend integration with Employee Central and robust security protocols.[7]

8. Documented impacts post-enabling the feature include improved employee and manager productivity by streamlining access to all active employments in one app, increased data accuracy from direct employment context selection, and enhanced HR process efficiency by reducing manual interventions for employment switching-related tasks. However, specific quantitative performance metrics or case study results are limited in public sources.[1][7]

9. Organizations need to plan mobile environment configurations including prerequisite Employee Central provisioning schema settings, provisioning app schema updates for employmentNav handling, necessary user access configurations, and mobile app version deployment aligned with SAP release timelines. User training on the employment switching feature and ongoing monitoring of usage and errors is recommended.[3][7]

## Comprehensive Research Report on SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Multiple Employment Management and Switching

### 1. Technical and Functional Capabilities Before Employment Switching Introduction

Before the introduction of multiple active employment switching in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile, the app had limited capabilities in managing multiple employment records per user. The primary limitation was that the mobile app did not support concurrent employment or global assignment features, unlike the desktop Employee Central interface where such scenarios could be managed. Employees with multiple active employments could only access their primary employment profile on mobile, with no functional means to switch or view secondary employments. Core HR data management, leave requests, timesheets, pay statements, and other standard mobile features were confined to single employment context per user session. This limitation restricted use cases involving multiple active employments and caused fragmentation in managing multirole workers remotely via mobile. The anticipated roadmap planned the introduction of employment switching capabilities in 2H 2025, enabling a more complete mobile experience for complex employment scenarios.[1]

### 2. Definition and Structure of Multiple Active Employments in Employee Central

SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central structures multiple active employments as separate "EmpEmployment" entities related to the same "Person" record. Each employment record represents one active assignment or job, identified by attributes such as assignment class "ST" (standard job) or "GA" (global assignment). When an employee holds concurrent jobs, each job is modeled as a distinct employment entity with its own User entity for authentication and access control. Key use cases requiring this structure revolve around worker conversions (e.g., full-time to contractor), rehiring scenarios where profiles are retained with distinct employment histories, employees holding multiple part-time or regional roles simultaneously, and global assignments with temporary relocations. Managers and HR administrators need to switch contexts between employments to view role-specific org charts, perform reviews, manage approvals, and run employment-specific reports. Structuring the data this way permits granular security, precise data provisioning, and compliance with labor laws and organizational policies.[9][3]

### 3. Workflow, UI Elements, Security, and Data Synchronization in Mobile for Employment Switching

With the feature introduced in 2H 2025, SAP SuccessFactors Mobile apps provide a dedicated UI allowing employees and managers to switch between active employment records. The workflow involves:

- Displaying a clear list/dropdown of all active employments tied to the user.
- Users select the employment they wish to manage, triggering a context switch.
- The app reloads employment-specific data such as profile, org chart, reviews, and transactions.

UI elements include:

- Employment selector menus on the home/dashboard screens.
- Context indicators showing current active employment.
- Visual cues differentiating employment records by location, job title, or assignment type.

Security protocols:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) verifies user permissions per employment.
- Identity management ensures that switching employment contexts does not create cross-employment data leakage.
- Authentication tokens maintain session integrity per employment record.

Data synchronization mechanisms:

- Real-time sync fetches updated employment data upon switching.
- Background synchronization aligns local app data with backend Employee Central to maintain consistency.
- Optimizations guarantee minimal latency and prevent stale data display.

The identity and access rights management cross-reference the user’s roles attached to each employment entity, ensuring proper segregation and access to employment-specific functionality without overlap or security compromise.[7][1]

### 4. Impact of Employment Switching on Access to Features and Backend Processes

Switching active employments dynamically changes the data context in features such as the Organizational Chart and 360-degree Reviews. For example:

- The Organizational Chart reflects only the hierarchy related to the selected employment.
- 360-degree Reviews load targets, competencies, and feedback relevant solely to the active employment.
- Leave balances, payroll data, and other processes update accordingly.

Backend integration points mainly involve:

- The Employee Central RESTful services providing filtered data per employment.
- Mobile app caches and local storage systems optimized to sync only active employment data.
- Middleware services ensuring smooth data retrieval through APIs that respect employment context parameters.

Performance considerations involve:

- Efficient handling of employment context switching without re-authenticating repeatedly.
- Cache management preventing redundant API calls yet ensuring freshness of critical HR data.
- Monitoring network throughput and app responsiveness during employment switch actions to avoid poor user experience.[7]

### 5. Recommended Methodological Approaches and Best Practices

SAP and industry best practices emphasize:

- Clear UI/UX design showing employment selections with intuitive flow and minimal cognitive load.
- Consistent employment labeling (e.g., location, role, department) to help users distinguish records.
- Secure data partitions and robust identity validation to comply with GDPR and other regulations.
- Thorough testing of multi-employment workflows on diverse mobile devices considering connectivity variability.
- User training programs emphasizing the function and limits of multiple employment switching.
