## Concept and Definition of Candidate Experience in Recruiting

Candidate experience broadly refers to how job seekers perceive and react to an employer’s recruiting process—from the initial awareness of a job opening, through application, interview, and hiring steps, to post-interview and onboarding processes. It encapsulates every interaction a candidate has with the employer’s recruitment system and personnel. 

Leading industry sources emphasize candidate experience as critical for attracting and retaining top talent while reinforcing employer brand strength. It comprises transparent communication, ease of application, timely updates, respectful treatment, and a personalized journey.

SAP’s description of **The Reimagined Candidate Experience** rests on creating a candidate journey that is **seamless, personalized, and engaging**, powered by modern interface design and AI enhancements. This approach focuses on reducing friction through digital tooling that adapts dynamically to candidate needs and job specifics, facilitating quick and relevant data capture, and enabling candidates to manage their journey effectively.

Core components according to SAP include:
- **Guided Application Experience**: Smooth, intuitive, adaptive application flow that tailors based on job requirements.
- **Dynamic Capability of Fields**: Intelligent form field behavior that adjusts to candidate inputs.
- **My Applications**: A candidate’s dashboard for managing active and past applications.
- **My Profile**: Centralized profile management for personal details, skills, and preferences.
- **Manage Account**: Secure account management for authentication and data privacy.

SAP’s reimagined experience is thus holistic, blending usability, personalization, and AI to keep candidates informed, empowered, and connected throughout the recruitment lifecycle.[1][5][7]
