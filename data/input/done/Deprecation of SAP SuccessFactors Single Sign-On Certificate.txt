# Detailed Report on SAP SuccessFactors SSO Certificate Deprecation and Migration to SAP Cloud Identity Services

## 1. Current Architecture and Technology of SAP SuccessFactors SSO Certificate Authentication

SAP SuccessFactors currently supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0 protocol, integrating with corporate Identity Providers (IdPs) to authenticate users seamlessly. The architecture involves SAP SuccessFactors as the Service Provider (SP) accepting SAML assertions signed and encrypted using X.509 certificates. These certificates are crucial for validating the identity assertions from the IdP, verifying SAML responses/assertions signatures to establish trust.

The X.509 certificates used in the SuccessFactors SSO mechanism serve multiple purposes:

- Signing SAML assertions sent by the IdP (corporate identity provider).
- Encrypting assertion data if required.
- Signing logout requests for SP-initiated logout scenarios.

Certificates are exchanged and configured between the SP and IdP, establishing SAML trust. SAP SuccessFactors requires HTTPS for all communications and uses POST binding for SAML responses to secure protocol exchange.

Within the broader HCM suite and integrated systems, the certificate-based SSO mechanism permits corporate users to authenticate once via their corporate IdP and access SuccessFactors without additional login prompts. The certificate controls the cryptographic validations necessary for establishing and maintaining secure sessions and identity verification.[1][7]

## 2. Technical Specifications, Lifecycle, and Management of the June 2, 2025 Certificate

The SAP SuccessFactors SSO certificate scheduled to expire on June 2, 2025, is an X.509 certificate used to sign and validate SAML authentication assertions. The technical specifications typically include:

- X.509 format, RSA key algorithm.
- Signature algorithm often SHA-256.
- Key length commonly 2048 bits or higher.
- Validity configured with explicit start and expiry dates.
- Issued either by a corporate Certificate Authority (CA) or self-signed.

The lifecycle involves deployment, active use, monitoring for expiry, and renewal or replacement before expiration. Proper management practices include proactive scheduling for certificate renewal to avoid authentication disruptions.

Dependencies and potential risks:

- All corporate IdPs and Service Providers (like SuccessFactors instances) must have the updated certificate to verify SAML tokens.
- Expiry leads to failed authentication attempts, locking users out of SuccessFactors.
- Integrated solutions relying on SSO (e.g., portals, APIs) also risk downtime.
- poor coordination during renewal can disrupt global business operations relying on SSO.

SAP SuccessFactors recommends planning migration or renewal well ahead of the expiry to avoid system access interruptions.[1]

## 3. SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication (SCI-IA): Capabilities and Differences

SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication (SCI-IA) is SAP’s modern cloud-based identity service designed to centralize and enhance authentication across SAP applications, including SuccessFactors.

Key capabilities include:

- Support for multiple authentication protocols: SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect.
- Acting as a Proxy IdP that consolidates identity sources including corporate IdPs.
- Delegated authentication via SAML proxy to existing corporate IdPs.
- Automated user provisioning and lifecycle management tools.
- Advanced risk-based authentication and adaptive access controls.
- Scalability designed for enterprise cloud environments with high availability.
- Tight integration with SAP Business Technology Platform and other SAP Cloud products.

Difference from certificate-based SSO:

- SCI-IA operates as a centralized identity broker rather than relying exclusively on certificate-based SAML assertions from multiple IdPs.
- Supports broader authentication standards and modern protocols.
- Provides enhanced security features like risk analysis and multi-factor authentication.
- Offers delegated authentication, allowing legacy IdPs to be retained behind SCI-IA.
- Manages user lifecycle and roles centrally with improved scalability and operational simplicity.

Operationally, SCI-IA simplifies identity management, improves security posture, and enhances user experience through unified cloud authentication, beyond the limitations of stand-alone SAML certificate usage.[3][7][10][1]

## 4. Recommended Migration Process from Certificate-Based SSO to SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication

A best-practice migration from SuccessFactors certificate-based SSO to SCI-IA involves detailed planning, a phased approach, and comprehensive testing.

### Detailed Steps and Configurations

- **Planning & Discovery:** Identify all SuccessFactors instances, integrations, and dependencies related to current SSO certificates.
- **Establish SCI-IA Tenant:** Provision SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant dedicated for the organization.
- **Configure SAML Trust:** Set up trust relationships:
  - Between SCI-IA and corporate IdPs using SAML proxy or delegated authentication.
  - Between SCI-IA and SuccessFactors instances as SP.
- **User Provisioning Setup:** Configure identity provisioning for users and mappings to roles in SCI-IA and SuccessFactors.
- **Certificate Management:** Replace legacy certificates with SCI-IA-generated certificates for signing and encryption.
- **Authentication Flows:** Define default or conditional authentication scenarios (e.g., corporate user SSO versus external user password scenarios).
- **Test Authentication:** Perform thorough end-to-end testing with user groups to validate access, role assignments, and SSO flows.
- **Rollout in Phases:** Gradually cut over from old certificate-based system to SCI-IA per SuccessFactors instance or business unit to minimize risk.
- **Monitoring & Support:** Monitor active sessions, user feedback, and logs closely after migration.
- **Decommission Old Certificates:** Retire old certificates and configuration only after stable operation confirmed.

### Dependencies and Timelines

- Dependencies include corporate IdP readiness for delegated SAML, SuccessFactors configuration access, and internal IT resources.
- Timelines may vary but ideally complete migration 30-60 days before certificate expiry to allow rollback windows.

This process ensures a secure and seamless migration minimizing business disruption and compliance risks.[7][1]
