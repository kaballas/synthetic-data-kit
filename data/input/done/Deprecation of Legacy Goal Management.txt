## 1. Detailed Definition, Scope, and Historical Evolution of the Legacy Goal Management System in SAP

### Definition and Scope

The legacy Goal Management system in SAP SuccessFactors is a core component within the broader Career Development, Performance & Goals, and Succession & Development product suite. Its primary purpose was to enable users—primarily HR professionals, managers, and employees—to create, manage, track, and evaluate individual and group goals aligned with organizational objectives. The legacy system supported full goal plan templates that could be customized to specific business needs, supporting both development and performance goals.

Key features included:

- Goal plan layout customization, allowing configuration of fields, goal types, and templates.
- Group Goals and Team Goals functionalities, though with distinctions affecting integration.
- Alignment and linking of goals with performance forms and succession planning.
- Tracking goal progress and history of goal modifications.
- Capability to set SMART goals and manage goal categories, weights, and tasks.

The user base was broad, spanning HR administrators, managers conducting performance reviews, employees managing their own goals, and organizational leadership overseeing talent development.

### Historical Evolution

Initially, the legacy Goal Management system operated with a data model that distinguished group goals appearing on manager's goal plans, while team goals did not. Over time, with the evolution of SAP SuccessFactors, customers demanded more modern, flexible, and integrated solutions.

To meet these needs, SAP began developing a new version of the Goal Management system, called the "latest Goal Management," which introduced:

- A reimagined user interface designed for better user experience and easier navigation.
- Improved integration with other SuccessFactors modules, like performance management and career development.
- Enhanced support for continuous feedback and dynamic goal updates.
- Stronger automation and reporting capabilities.
- Removal or redesign of some legacy features not compatible with new data models, such as group goals.

This transition evolved during 2023, with the newer Goal Management system becoming generally available in the first half of 2023. Customers were encouraged to manually upgrade from the legacy system via the Upgrade Center, with a universal push planned for the first half of 2025.

## 2. Official SAP Timelines, Policies, and Documentation on Legacy Goal Management Deprecation

### Key Dates and Policies

SAP officially announced the following key milestones for the legacy Goal Management system:

- **End of Development:** November 17, 2023  
  - After this date, SAP stopped enhancing or adding new features to the legacy system. High-priority bug fixes continued but only until End of Maintenance.
  
- **End of Maintenance:** May 17, 2024  
  - SAP ceased all bug fixes and patches after this date. The legacy system stopped receiving maintenance support, though SAP continued to provide how-to support answering customer queries.

- **Deletion/Removal:** December 31, 2026  
  - From this date, the legacy Goal Management system would no longer be available for productive use. Customers needed to have migrated to the latest Goal Management version.

### Rationale and Strategic Goals for Deprecation

SAP’s rationale for deprecating the legacy system centers on:

- Providing customers with a more modern, scalable, and integrated solution that aligns with the evolving landscape of HR technology.
- Enhancing user experience with a redesigned interface and workflow improvements.
- Supporting new HR trends such as dynamic goal management, continuous performance feedback, and integration with advanced talent analytics.
- Simplifying the technology stack by retiring outdated architecture and introducing a unified system that is more maintainable and adaptable.

SAP communicated these goals through official customer communications, community posts, and documentation emphasizing the benefits of the new system and the importance of planning the migration to avoid business disruption.

## 1. Legacy Goal Management System: Definition, Scope, and Historical Evolution

The legacy Goal Management system in SAP SuccessFactors is a foundational tool aimed at managing employee goals within career development, performance management, and succession planning modules. Its primary scope included goal creation, tracking, alignment with organizational objectives, integration with performance reviews, and supporting both individual and group/team goals. The user base comprises HR administrators, managers, employees, and organizational leaders involved in talent and performance management.

Historically, the legacy system featured a robust but traditional interface and data model. Group goals were managed distinctly, appearing on managers’ plans differently than team goals, affecting integrations with performance forms and ratings. Customers benefited from detailed customization of goal plan templates, including SMART goals, weights, categories, and task/target tables.

As HR tech evolved, SAP introduced the latest Goal Management version in the first half of 2023, reimagining the UI/UX and data model to support modern performance practices such as continuous feedback, improved integrations, and simplified management. Legacy features like group goals saw limited or no support due to underlying model changes. The legacy system coexisted with the latest version until planned deprecation milestones.[1][3]

## 2. SAP Timelines, Policies, and Rationale for Deprecating Legacy Goal Management

SAP’s official timeline includes:

- **End of Development:** November 17, 2023
- **End of Maintenance:** May 17, 2024 (no bug fixes or patches after this)
- **Deletion:** December 31, 2026 (end of productive use)

SAP’s rationale centers on replacing legacy Goal Management with a modernized product delivering better user experience, integration, scalability, and alignment with future HR trends like AI-driven goal setting and talent analytics. The deprecation aims to eliminate support overhead of old architecture, encourage adoption of improved workflows, and secure business process continuity through standardized solutions.[1]

## 3. Technical, Functional, and User Experience Differences Between Legacy and Latest Goal Management

### Technical and Functional Differences

- **Data Model:** Legacy Goal Management supported group goals distinctly from team goals, with group goals appearing on manager’s plans. The latest version simplifies this by removing group goals and standardizing on team goals, impacting integration and goal aggregation logic.
- **Feature Set:** Some features in legacy like SMART goal configuration, category-level counts/weights, print layouts, tasks/targets tables, and link/align goal functionality have limited or no current support in the latest version, though SAP plans phased feature additions.
- **Integration:** Legacy integrates tightly with the Performance Form and Succession modules, but newer Goal Management offers enhanced integration across SuccessFactors modules, including seamless workflows for continuous feedback, development goals, and career progression.
- **Customization:** Legacy allows maintaining existing goal plan templates fully, while latest version requires adoption of new templates optimized for its UI and data model. Conversion scenarios support partial template reuse but with limitations, especially where group goals exist.
- **User Experience:** The latest version introduces a reimagined interface with streamlined navigation, more intuitive goal entry and tracking, and better mobile device compatibility. The legacy UI is considered more cumbersome and less suited for modern workforce engagement.[3][7]

### User Experience Impacts

Users familiar with legacy workflows will face changes in goal visibility (no group goals), navigation, and template handling. The simplified interface seeks to improve adoption but requires adjustment, and ongoing feedback collection shapes incremental improvements.

## 4. Typical Challenges, Risks, and Impacts in Transitioning to New Goal Management

### Data Integrity and Migration

- Migrating goal data, especially with active group goals, is complex. Group goals are unsupported in the new system, requiring archiving or closure before migration.
- Template conversion is partial; full reuse may not be possible, leading to reconfiguration efforts.
- Data continuity risks include potential loss of goal history or misalignment in goal tracking metrics.

### Performance Management Process Continuity

- Overlapping goal cycles (legacy open for reviews while latest is live) create complexity in managing active goals.
- Integration touchpoints with performance forms and succession need retesting to ensure no disruption.
- Employee confusion due to UI changes and changed feature sets can impact goal-setting effectiveness.

### User Adoption Challenges

- Resistance to change due to altered user experience and loss of familiar legacy features like group goals.
- Training needs for managers and employees to understand new workflows.
- Communication gaps may raise concerns about feature loss or process disruption.

### System Interoperability

- Ensuring seamless data interchange between Goal Management and other Career, Performance, and Succession modules.
- Compatibility with existing custom integrations or reports needs validation.
- Risk of downtime or data synchronization errors during cutover.

## 5. Recommended Methodologies and Best Practices for Managing Deprecation Transition

- **Risk Mitigation:** Early identification and archiving of group goals, staged migration plans, and fallback options.
- **Communication:** Clear, ongoing updates to stakeholders, highlighting benefits and timelines. Use SAP community and official communications.
- **Timeline Planning:** Align upgrade efforts with goal cycles. Avoid mid-cycle heavy changes; prefer upgrades between cycles.
- **Training:** Provide role-specific training templates, hands-on sessions, and FAQs to ease user transition.
- **Template Management:** Assess existing templates for compatibility; create parallel templates in latest system for validation.
- **Testing:** Pilot deployments and thorough integration testing with Performance and Succession modules.
