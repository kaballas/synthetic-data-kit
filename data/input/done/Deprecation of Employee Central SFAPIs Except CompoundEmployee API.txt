Collected initial sources with key info about SAP SuccessFactors SOAP API deprecations and migrations:

- SOAP-based SFAPIs for Employee Central, except CompoundEmployee API, deprecated with EoM May 17, 2024, deletion May 23, 2025. Migration to OData APIs required.[1][3][7][8]
- SAP official developer guide on SFAPI deprecation, promotes using OData APIs, highlights deprecated Partner API, Adhoc, and simple entity SFAPIs.[5][7]
- CompoundEmployee API not deprecated, no announcement on its removal.[7][1][5]
- Deprecation implications include migration away from basic authentication, moving to SAP Cloud Identity Services for SSO, transition to OData APIs with better performance, security.[3][1]
- Migration strategies and recommendations on use of Integration Center and OData APIs referenced.[5]
- No detailed official migration case studies or deep architectural contrasts yet in initial data; additional data gathering needed.

Next, to deepen research and answer each question thoroughly, including detailed technical specs of SOAP SFAPIs and CompoundEmployee API, official SAP timelines, integration impacts, alternatives, migration best practices, risks, and future outlook, I will conduct additional focused searches:

- "SFAPI SOAP APIs technical specifications Employee Central"
- "CompoundEmployee API SuccessFactors architecture and functions"
- "SAP official documentation SFAPI deprecation timeline"
- "Migration strategies from SFAPI SOAP to OData SuccessFactors"
- "Challenges migrating from SFAPI SOAP to OData SuccessFactors"
