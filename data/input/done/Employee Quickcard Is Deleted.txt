## Overview of the Employee Quickcard Feature on SAP Platform

The employee quickcard was a small "rolodex-card" style icon displayed next to employee names in various name lists across the SAP system, including forms such as "My Forms" and "My Goals" pages. When clicked, the quickcard would open a popup window showing dynamic, role- and permission-based information about the employee:

- Contact information (e.g., name, job title, location, business phone, email)
- Links to performance-related areas like Goal Plan, Employee Scorecard, and Performance Form, if applicable and accessible per user permissions
- Ability to send email directly through the quickcard
- Features like writing notes about the person

The quickcards were largely standardized with hard-coded elements, meaning most content was not customizable beyond certain toggles or permissions settings. Custom fields were not supported by default but could be altered through workarounds or repurposing of standard fields. The quickcard served as a consolidated quick-access hub to key employee data and relevant performance management tools, intended to streamline HR-related workflows and improve user efficiency by reducing navigation time across multiple modules.

From a technical and UX perspective, the quickcard provided a compact, integrated interaction flow where relevant information was surfaced quickly as a contextual overlay without requiring page reloads or deep navigation into employee profiles. This design aimed to enhance the user experience by boosting speed, simplifying access, and dynamically tailoring content to security and role contexts.

## Reasons and Justifications for Deleting the Employee Quickcard

SAP officially deleted the employee quickcard feature around May 16, 2025. From the available official sources and SAP support documentation, the disclosed reasons included:

- Strategic shift towards a more unified and modernized user experience aligned with broader platform evolution goals, emphasizing streamlined and updated UI elements.
- Technical rationale related to the quickcard’s legacy architecture, which was partially locked down in terms of customization and lacked flexibility to adapt to newer SAP SuccessFactors features.
- Desire to retire less-supported legacy components to reduce maintenance overhead and simplify the feature set, allowing focus on better-integrated alternatives.

SAP's release notes and official communication highlighted that disabling and deleting card types (including quickcards) followed a process where disabling the card type stopped generation of new instances, and deletion jobs removed existing instances to clean up. SAP indicated that this removal was part of an effort to improve the overall home page and navigation experiences by making way for more adaptive and configurable solutions.

## Impact on User Experience After Deletion

Community discussions, customer feedback, and support forum posts reveal mixed but generally significant impacts on user workflows post-deletion:

- Loss of one-click access to consolidated employee info, which had previously enabled quick differentiation of roles such as Employee vs Manager and visibility of direct reports with minimal clicks.
- Users reported a decline in efficiency, stating that tasks which required quick access to employee data or performance forms now involved additional navigation steps, increasing time and cognitive load.
- Some frustration and dissatisfaction appeared in forums where users lamented the disappearance of such streamlined features, citing a gap in the ease of access and instant information visibility.
- Quantitative data from surveys and usability studies (when available) showed a drop in user satisfaction scores regarding employee data retrieval and interaction speed on affected pages.

## Alternatives and Replacement Features Introduced by SAP

SAP recommended or introduced alternative approaches to compensate for the removal of the employee quickcard:

- Enhanced home page cards and quick actions offering more configurable and product-specific card interactions for accessing performance and HR data.
- A move towards Employee Central Quick Actions, enabling simplified and task-oriented access to self-service offerings for employees and managers.
- Emphasis on more scalable and customizable UI components replacing hard-coded quickcards, allowing adaptation to diverse organizational configurations and modern UX standards.

While these alternatives aimed to fulfill similar use cases—streamlining access to employee-related data and actions—they often required additional configuration and did not always replicate the exact consolidated quickcard experience. Their usability varied by organizational setup and user roles.

## Technical and Design Challenges of Removal and Transition

Removing the quickcard and implementing alternatives brought several challenges:

- Migration required disabling the quickcard card type in system settings, deleting existing instances, and ensuring no user workflows depended critically on it without replacement.
- Design challenges involved reimagining user flows that had relied on the quickcard’s compact popup modal approach to instead use broader, sometimes multiple-page interaction sequences.
- Compatibility issues arose with integrated modules that had assumed the quickcard’s availability, necessitating updates in roles, permissions, and UI bindings.
- Transition guides emphasized careful change management and communication, highlighting risks of user disruption and need for training on alternative navigation patterns.

These challenges slowed adoption of new features and led to some user resistance initially.

## User and Organizational Adaptation Strategies

Organizations and users adjusted in multiple ways:

- Reconfiguring their SAP setups to leverage new card types and quick action menus, tailoring visibility settings to restore quick access points though with some compromise on ease.
- Training users on alternative workflows and encouraging use of enhanced search, filters, and navigation tools.
- Third-party consultancies recommended phased rollouts and user feedback loops to iteratively refine configurations.
- Case studies showed that organizations that proactively communicated changes and provided support saw smoother transitions and less productivity loss.

Common pitfalls included underestimating user frustration and failing to customize alternatives to specific organizational needs, causing workflow inefficiencies.
