## Core Functionalities and Features of Temporary Holiday Calendar and Work Schedule Quick Approval Cards

The temporary holiday calendar and temporary work schedule quick approval cards are part of SAP Employee Central and Time Tracking modules within the SAP SuccessFactors Time Management suite. Their core purpose is to facilitate the management of temporary changes to employees' time-related data, primarily work schedules and holiday calendars, without requiring permanent job information changes.

- **Temporary Holiday Calendar:**
  - Allows assigning an alternate holiday calendar for a defined temporary period.
  - Useful in scenarios like business travel where employees should observe local holidays of a different location.
  - Overrides the default holiday calendar assigned in Job Information just for the specified time period.
  - Employees can create requests for temporary holiday calendar changes via employee self-service UI.
  - These changes can be subjected to approvals as per configured workflows.
  - The new Temporary Time Information object includes a **Category** field allowing selection between "Work Schedule" and "Holiday Calendar," enabling the creation of temporary entries for either category.
  - Overlapping temporary holiday calendars are restricted unless special collision resolution is enabled.

- **Temporary Work Schedule:**
  - Enables temporary changes to an employeeâ€™s work schedule for specific periods.
  - Similar UI and workflow-based approval process as the holiday calendar changes.
  - Facilitates management of short-term schedule shifts without altering permanent job records.
  
- **Quick Approval Cards:**
  - These cards provide managers and approvers with an intuitive interface to view and approve or reject temporary changes quickly.
  - They highlight effective periods, category of change, and the specifics of the temporary time information.
  - Designed to streamline approval workflows by consolidating change requests in a manageable worklist form.

- **Types of Temporary Time Information Changes Supported:**
  - Temporary holiday calendar assignments (e.g., local holiday adjustments during travel).
  - Temporary work schedule changes (e.g., shift swaps, short-term schedule adjustments).
  - These temporary changes are stored in the "Temporary Time Information" object, which captures employee ID, start/end date, category (work schedule or holiday calendar), and the specific calendar or schedule applied.

## Recent Enhancements to Temporary Holiday Calendar and Work Schedule Quick Approval Cards

Recent SAP SuccessFactors Time Management 2H 2024 and 1H 2025 releases introduced several significant enhancements focused on user interaction, data presentation, and workflow efficiency.

- **Improved Display and UI Adjustments:**
  - Introduction of a **Category field** in Temporary Time Information object to clearly distinguish between holiday calendar and work schedule changes.
  - Enhanced employee self-service interfaces enabling easy creation and deletion of temporary holiday calendars and work schedules.
  - The quick approval cards display expanded fields including category, effective dates, and contextual summaries for easier decision-making.
  - Deep linking capability to time forms expedites access for approvers and employees.

- **Enhanced Approval Workflows:**
  - Workflow-triggered approval for temporary holiday calendar and work schedule changes, configurable per organizational needs.
  - Notifications and alerts for approvers when temporary changes require review.
  - Support for preventing overlapping temporary holiday calendar periods unless explicitly allowed via Time Management Collision Resolution settings.

- **New Data Fields and Management Options:**
  - Temporary Time Information object now supports the "Category" field as a central control point.
  - Ability to search temporary holiday calendars by country/region or calendar name in employee self-service mode.
  - Enabling deletion or amendments of temporary changes within the configured approval period.

- **Integration with Payroll and Compliance:**
  - Temporary changes are replicable to SAP payroll systems ensuring accurate pay processing based on actual working and holiday time.
  - Regulatory compliance features ensuring public holidays associated with the current work location (especially during travel) are respected in time management calculations.

Through these enhancements, SAP aims to make temporary time information changes more transparent, manageable, and compliant with organizational and legal requirements while ensuring the user experience for employees and managers is intuitive and responsive.[1][3][5][9][10]

## Technical Architectures and Integration Mechanisms

- **Data Capture and Storage:**
  - Temporary changes are captured in the generic SAP SuccessFactors object called **Temporary Time Information**.
  - This object includes fields like employee ID, start and end dates, the category of change (work schedule or holiday calendar), and a reference to the specific calendar or work schedule.
  - Changes entered through employee self-service or admin workbench are validated against existing time data and collision rules.

- **Validation and Collision Resolution:**
  - The system checks for overlapping temporary time entries.
  - By default, overlapping holiday calendars are not allowed unless the "Allow Split and Delimit for Temporary Time Information" option within the Time Management Collision Resolution configuration object is enabled.

- **Workflow Integration:**
  - When a temporary change is submitted, a configured workflow is triggered, routing the request to designated managers or approvers.
  - Workflows are configurable in Employee Central and can integrate with SAP Business Workflow or SAP Cloud Platform Workflow services.

- **Data Replication and Synchronization:**
  - Approved temporary changes are replicated to related modules, including SAP Payroll and Time Tracking systems.
  - Synchronization ensures payroll calculations and attendance data reflect temporary schedules/holidays in quasi-real time.

- **User Interface Components:**
  - Quick approval cards operate within SAP Fiori and SuccessFactors Employee Central interfaces.
  - Incorporate deep linking for faster navigation, dynamic field population, and context-sensitive editing capabilities.

- **APIs and Integration Points:**
  - Use of OData APIs, integration center, and SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI) for exchanging temporary time data across HR, Payroll, and payroll-related third-party systems.
  - Ensures consistent application of temporary time information across the SAP ecosystem.

## Alignment with Best Practices in Time Management Systems

- **Compliance and Auditability:**
  - Temporary holiday calendar ensures local labor law compliance, especially when employees travel internationally.
  - The approval workflows provide an audit trail documenting the origin, approval, and adjustment of temporary time records.
  - The system's restriction on overlapping temporary entries and its collision resolution mechanisms prevent data inconsistencies.

- **Real-Time Synchronization:**
  - Temporary changes reflect promptly in payroll and attendance modules, reducing delays and errors in payroll processing.
  - Deep links and intuitive approval cards improve responsiveness and transparency.

- **Standard Approaches Compared to SAP Enhancements:**
