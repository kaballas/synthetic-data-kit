## 1. Legacy People Profile: Definitions, Components, Functionalities, Role, Customization

- **Definition**: Legacy People Profile is the older version of the employee profile experience in SAP SuccessFactors. It serves as a primary interface to view and edit employee information gathered from Employee Central and other integrated modules like Learning, Performance, and Compensation. It is considered less modern and more static compared to the latest People Profile experience.[3][5]

- **Core Components**:
  - Data blocks or sections that represent various types of employee data (e.g., personal info, job info, competencies).
  - Integration points with other SuccessFactors modules.
  - Role-Based Permissions (RBP) controls access and editing rights, though with less granularity than newer configurations.
  - Public Profile: A subset of the full profile for public or colleague-facing display showing limited data like name and title.
  
- **Functionalities**:
  - View/edit employee master data and related talent management information.
  - Allows managers and employees to review key information such as competencies, goals, and career history.
  - Support for some level of customization where admins can configure which sections or fields appear.
  - Serves as a data repository in some cases when Employee Central is not fully deployed.

- **Role and Customization Options**:
  - Configuration involves defining which blocks/sections show up.
  - Limited layout flexibility compared to later versions.
  - Permissions control access to sections but not deeply granular field-level control.
  - Mainly driven by standard and limited custom fields.
  
This legacy system is still present technically but is largely being replaced by the newer People Profile and Full Profile experiences.[5][9]

## 2. Latest Full Profile Experience vs Legacy People Profile: Architectural and Functional Differences, Prerequisites, and Limitations

- **Architectural Differences**:
  - Full Profile experience consolidates all employee data into a single, unified data hub view.
  - It is built on a modern UI framework offering a card-based layout that is highly configurable and dynamic.
  - The latest People Profile includes both Full Profile and Public Profile views, emphasizing modularity.
  - Data integration is broader, encompassing Employee Central, Performance, Learning, Compensation, etc.
  - More granular Role-Based Permissions enable precise control over who can see and edit each card or field.

- **Functional Differences**:
  - Full Profile offers a revamped data hub that is more user-friendly and visually intuitive.
  - Allows enhanced customization of layout and data presentation compared to legacy.
  - Supports more comprehensive data elements including advanced talent and compensation data.
  - Better performance and responsiveness with modern technologies.
  
- **Technical Prerequisites**:
  - Often requires Employee Central to be fully enabled and properly configured.
  - Needs proper setup of RBP and permission structures.
  - May require enabling specific provisioning settings and feature flags from SAP.
  - Custom fields and data must be mapped correctly in migration to function in Full Profile.
  
- **Limitations**:
  - Some legacy configurations or customizations do not directly translate and require adjustments.
  - Not all legacy People Profile blocks have a one-to-one equivalent in Full Profile.
  - Feature parity is still evolving, so some niche functionalities may not be fully migrated.
  
Full Profile is the SAP recommended modern way forward, offering a powerful, extensible platform framed around improved user experience and comprehensive data aggregation.[1][9][5]

## 5. Previewing Full Profile Experience Post-Migration: UI and Data Inspection Elements

- **Preview Functionality**:
  - Admins can enable a preview mode to inspect the Full Profile UI without enabling it for all employees.
  - This preview shows the card layout, data displayed, and access controls as they will appear live.
  - Provides a way to simulate employee and manager views based on permissions.

- **UI and Data Elements to Inspect**:
  - Card arrangement and visibility.
  - Data accuracy and completeness in each card.
  - Role-based access reflections (who sees what).
  - Editable versus read-only fields.
  - Integration of external module data such as performance or learning.

- **Validation Benefits**:
  - Helps catch configuration errors before full rollout.
  - Facilitates stakeholder review and feedback.
  - Ensures user experience consistency and data security adherence.
