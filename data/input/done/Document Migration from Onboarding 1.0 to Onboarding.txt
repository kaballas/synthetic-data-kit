# Deep Research Report on Migrating SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding 1.0 to the Latest Onboarding Solution

***

## Overview

SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding 1.0 is the original standalone onboarding module designed to manage new hire, crossboarding, and offboarding processes within organizations. It was built on an older, separate technology stack that required distinct integration and management apart from core SuccessFactors modules. The latest version, historically termed Onboarding 2.0, now just "Onboarding," represents a major evolution built natively on the SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central (EC) platform. This new solution is part of the unified Human Experience Management (HXM) suite and leverages shared data models, user permissions, business rules, and infrastructure.

SAP has announced the end of maintenance for Onboarding 1.0 to begin in the second half of 2025, progressing to full end of life and sunset by mid-2026. Customers are strongly urged to migrate to the latest Onboarding solution before this timeframe.

## 1. Technical and Functional Differences Between Onboarding 1.0 and Latest Onboarding

### Platform and Architecture
- **Onboarding 1.0**: Built as an independent module on a separate platform with its own provisioning, user roles, and data model. It requires middleware integration with other SuccessFactors (SF) modules, resulting in dual maintenance of corporate structures, security, and picklists.
- **Latest Onboarding**: Fully embedded in the SAP SuccessFactors HXM platform sharing codebase and infrastructure with Employee Central. Uses the Metadata Framework (MDF) for configuration, business rules, role-based permissions, and modern UI paradigms.

### Core Features
- Onboarding 1.0 supports fundamental onboarding workflows, document management within Document Center, manual compliance form handling, basic reporting, and standalone user portals for new hires.
- The new Onboarding solution introduces:
  - Integrated pre-day 1 onboarding through unified portals.
  - Enhanced UI with a consistent experience aligned with the SF platform.
  - Automated workflows leveraging platform-wide business rules and events.
  - Electronic signature integration (SAP SuccessFactors e-Signature).
  - Unified document management through HXM Document Management System (DMS).
  - Improved reporting capabilities leveraging People Analytics.
  - Seamless integration with SAP SF Learning and other modules.
  - Enhanced extensibility for 3rd party integrations.

### User Interface Enhancements
- Onboarding 1.0 has a legacy UI separate from the core SF suite needing separate user access.
- Latest Onboarding provides a modern, responsive UI integrated within the SF HXM platform including guided experiences, tailored content, and consolidated access from the employee homepage.

### Supported Document Types
- Onboarding 1.0 uses Document Center for document storage supporting various file types, but management is separate.
- The latest Onboarding uses SAP Document Management System, unifying document storage with improved metadata support, version control, and more comprehensive document type support integrated across modules.

## 2. Prerequisites, Limitations, and Compatibility for Migration

### Prerequisites
- The new Onboarding solution requires SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central (EC) to be in scope, at minimum as a "mini master" for foundation data (no full EC license required).
- Existing Onboarding 1.0 customers need to have stabilized their current environments and ensure compatibility with SF platform releases.
- Migration readiness includes ensuring data consistency in Onboarding 1.0 Document Center and configuration documentation for reimplementation.

### Limitations
- There is no fully automated lift-and-shift migration process due to the fundamental platform and data model differences.
- Forms, notifications, advanced conditions, custom integrations, and reports require manual reimplementation.
- Document migration is partially supported through tools only for specific document categories (e.g., Document Center documents, I-9 reverifications).
- Complex workflows and role permissions do not migrate automatically and require reconstruction.

### Compatibility
- Migration tools support common document formats used in Onboarding 1.0 (PDFs, DOCs, images) for transfer to the new DMS.
- System configurations and roles must be realigned to the new MDF-based permissions model.
- Users need appropriate provisioning in both the legacy and new Onboarding solutions during the transition.
