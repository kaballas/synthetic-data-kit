***

## 1. Fundamental Features, Definitions, and Intended Functionalities of People Profile, Profile Preview, and Spotlight

The latest **People Profile** in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central acts as a consolidated, comprehensive digital profile that aggregates a wide range of employee data into a singular, structured interface accessible to various roles such as employees, managers, and HR professionals. It integrates personal, job, organizational, and contingent workforce data to provide a unified view.

### Core Components:
- **Full Profile:** This is the evolved interface of People Profile that aggregates multiple data types into organized, card-style views known as "cards" or "portlets." Each card represents specific information domains (personal info, job details, organizational assignment, etc.).
- **Profile Preview:** A lightweight, summary view introduced as part of the latest People Profile experience. It allows quick access to essential employee information without navigating the full detailed profile.
- **Spotlight:** A feature designed to highlight key data points or alerts relevant to the user's role, such as upcoming anniversaries, training needs, compliance reminders, or contingent workforce alerts.

### Terminology and Baseline Capabilities Before Recent Changes:
- Previously, People Profile existed with more segmented views, allowing view/edit capabilities according to roles and permissions.
- User roles involve standard employees, managers, HR admins, contingent workforce admins.
- Data types include personal data, employment info, organizational assignments, benefits, compensation, contingent worker data.
- Profile capabilities were controlled by explicit admin settings, including an "Enable the latest People Profile" switch.

These components and data forms establish the groundwork allowing Profile Preview and Spotlight to seamlessly integrate as summary and highlight tools, enhancing navigation and data consumption efficiency within the Employee Central ecosystem.[3][7][9]

## 2. Rollout of Automatic Enablement and Removal of Admin Control Switch

SAP has transitioned the deployment model of Profile Preview and Spotlight by implementing **automatic enablement** across customer environments (both web and mobile platforms). This means:

- The former admin control toggle, "Enable the latest People Profile," was **removed** as a switchable feature.
- Profile Preview and Spotlight are now **enabled by default** and cannot be disabled by customers.
- The rollout follows a phased strategy prioritizing metadata-driven activation; no manual configuration is required going forward.
- On both web and mobile, these features are now default components of the user interface, ensuring consistent availability and improving user experience continuity.
- For administrators, this reduces configuration overhead but also removes granular control over enabling/disabling the latest People Profile experience.
- End-users benefit from immediate access to updated profile views and spotlight alerts without delay or administrative intervention.[7][3]
