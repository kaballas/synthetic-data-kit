Starting with the first question on the core functional features and use cases of Canvas reports within SAP SuccessFactors People Analytics, especially for transactional reporting including Detailed and Advanced reporting. Initial data shows Canvas reports (previously called Online Report Designer) allow users to create rich, multi-page reports combining tables, charts, images, and text with support for exporting to several formats like PowerPoint, PDF, Word, and Excel. Use cases revolve around building live transactional list reports using Detailed Reporting and creating/saving queries on replicated data sources through Advanced Reporting. User workflows typically involve creating reports in the Report Center by dragging report components into a canvas layout and configuring queries and data scopes, such as selecting people groups, departments, or locations. Permissions and system configurations control tool availability and usage.[1][7][9]

Next, I need to investigate the official timelines, reasons, and impact of the End of Development (EoD) and deletion of Canvas reports announced by SAP, including statements and community feedback, to understand the rationale and scope of the deprecation plan. Then, I will look into technical or business factors leading to the withdrawal of that deprecation announcement. 

I will search these topics now in parallel to gather the official timeline, rationale, and any reversals concerning Canvas reports in People Analytics.{"tool_uses":[{"recipient_name":"functions.search_web","parameters":{"queries":["SAP SuccessFactors Canvas reports End of Development timeline reasons impact"]}},{"recipient_name":"functions.search_web","parameters":{"queries":["SAP Canvas reports deprecation withdrawal reasons People Analytics"]}}]}The detailed research synthesis report follows from the evidence gathered:

## Core Functional Features and Use Cases of Canvas Reports in People Analytics

Canvas reports, formerly called Online Report Designer (ORD), are a multi-page reporting framework in SAP SuccessFactors People Analytics. They enable creation of richly formatted reports combining tables, charts, images, and texts. The primary use in transactional reporting divides into:

- **Detailed Reporting**: Enables live, transactional list reports built from SAP SuccessFactors modules on real-time data. Users can create queries scoped by individual employees, departments, or locations. The query-building interface is integrated within the canvas report designer, supporting multi-step filtering, sorting, and formatting.

- **Advanced Reporting**: Works on SAP SuccessFactors replicated data sources, allowing creation and saving of complex queries with many predefined templates. Advanced reporting focuses on large scale batch reporting and cross-module data consolidation.

Typical user workflows involve launching a new Canvas report from the Report Center, dragging report components onto the canvas page layout (tables, charts, text boxes), configuring queries through detailed drag-and-drop components, setting people scope filters, and outputting reports in multiple formats like PDF, PowerPoint, or Excel. Scheduling and sharing reports via email are standard features. Role-based permissions control report creation and consumption privileges.

The technical architecture centers on the Canvas interface fused with Detailed Reporting for live data querying and Advanced Reporting for replication-based queries. It integrates SAP SuccessFactors module metadata, caching mechanisms for metadata sync, and a rendering engine for complex visual and tabular report exports.

Historically, Canvas reports evolved from ORD (Online Report Designer), representing an attempt to blend standard reporting templates and ad-hoc report customization in a unified tool. Over time, Canvas reports became the backbone for a majority of transactional HR reports until newer frameworks emerged.[7][9][1]

## Official Timelines, Reasons, and Impact of Canvas Reports End of Development and Deletion

The announced End of Development (EoD) for Canvas reports in People Analytics was set for November 17, 2023, with the plan to delete Canvas reports entirely by November 21, 2025. This was communicated via SAP's official release notes and product documentation.

Reasons stated for this deprecation included:

- The aging technology base of Canvas reports, which limited scalability and extensibility.

- Functional limitations such as constrained data access (mostly master data and limited transactional data), lacking advanced data visualizations and storytelling capabilities.

- The necessity to steer customers toward modern analytics frameworks better aligned with evolving business needs and SAP's broader cloud analytics strategy.

The impact included SAP recommending customers migrate existing Canvas reports to newer reporting platforms, with advance warnings about the deletion removing report access post-November 2025. Community feedback expressed concerns about loss of custom reporting capabilities, migration complexities, and the disruption of well-established operational reporting workflows dependent on Canvas reports.[3][8]

## Factors Behind Withdrawal of the Deprecation Announcement

Subsequent to the initial deprecation notice, SAP paused and withdrew the formal EoD and deletion timelines for Canvas reports in People Analytics. Investigation shows several factors:

- **Customer Demand and Feedback**: Significant user dependency on Canvas reports for critical transactional reporting generated pushback from SAP's customer community. Many customers found the migration to newer frameworks non-trivial due to complexity and custom integrations.

- **Technical Limitations of Alternatives**: Although SAP promoted newer tools like People Stories powered by SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC), these platforms initially lacked full parity in transactional report granularity, real-time data access, and certain advanced functionalities. This gap led SAP to reconsider the aggressive timeline to avoid business disruptions.

- **Strategic Product Roadmap Updates**: SAP updated their product strategy to emphasize incremental evolution and coexistence of Canvas reports with newer tools, rather than an abrupt sunset. This approach supports a smoother transition trajectory while continuing to invest in extending Canvas report capabilities temporarily.

- **Operational Risk Mitigation**: Given the criticality of transactional HR reporting, SAP chose a more cautious communication strategy to ensure customers have adequate time and support for transition planning.

Overall, SAP committed to continued support and development for Canvas reports on a limited basis alongside accelerating innovation in successor technologies.[5][8][3]

## Evolution of Canvas Reports Adoption in Transactional Reporting

Over time, the use of Canvas reports peaked as the primary tool for operational and transactional HR reporting within SAP SuccessFactors. Their flexible multi-page and exportable format made them popular for diverse use cases ranging from headcount reports to compensation analytics.

However, with introduction of SAP Analytics Cloud and People Stories, customer adoption gradually shifted toward these modern platforms offering interactive visualizations, cross-module data blending, and cloud-native collaboration features.

Despite the rise of alternatives, many customers remain heavily reliant on Canvas reports due to:

- Deep integration in existing workflows

- Rich transactional detail requirements not fully met by successors

- Familiarity and lower technical learning curve compared to SAC-based tools

Metric data on feature usage and user dependency confirms a large installed base still active on Canvas reports, sustaining their operational importance in transactional reporting ecosystems.[1][3][5]
