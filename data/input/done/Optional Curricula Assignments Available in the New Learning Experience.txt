## Architecture, Functionality, and User Interface of the New Learning Home Page

The new Learning home page in SAP Learning is designed as a highly personalized, visually engaging interface that centralizes a user’s learning needs. It acts as a portal presenting both required and optional learning assignments, including courses, classes, and curricula, allowing users streamlined and immediate access to their learning portfolio.

- **Direct Access Feature**: Optional assignments and classes, linked to assigned curricula and sub-curricula, appear specifically in the "Important Learning" section of the home page. This section highlights non-required (optional) learning assignments proactively, making them easily discoverable.
  
- **UI Design Elements**:
  - Learning items are presented in card-based layouts with clear labels for assignment type.
  - Key interactive options such as "View All" provide comprehensive viewing of all optional learning, enabling evaluation based on personal interest and role relevance.
  - Functional actions including "Remove" (to mark as not interested) and "Bookmark" (to save for later) are available for optional assignments.
  - Filtering capabilities allow learners to refine optional assignments by type (Course, Class, Program) and assignment source (Manager or Administrator).
  
- **Functionality**: Users can navigate directly from the home page to detailed curriculum status pages, reinforcing transparency about progress in both required and optional learning elements.
  
- **Calendar Integration**: Certain interactive features like calendar blocking with .ics download assist learners in managing and scheduling their learning activities efficiently.[1][8][9]

## Integration of Optional Assignments and Classes with Curricula

- The structural integration between optional assignments/classes and assigned curricula and sub-curricula is supported through metadata relationships that distinguish required vs. optional status in the system.
- The architecture uses unique Curriculum IDs and item assignment types that define curricular structure and hierarchy.
- Optional assignments are linked as "non-required" learning items within curricula definitions, enabling them to be surfaced independently on the Learning home page.
- This linkage supports direct visibility and discovery on the home page by referencing user-assigned curricula and sub-curricula data, allowing the filtering of optional items within the user's assigned learning context.
- Assignment Profiles automate the assignment process by matching users to curricula based on attributes such as job codes or roles, pulling in optional components where configured.[3][5][1]

## User Roles, Permissions, and Personalization Settings

- Visibility of optional assignments from curricula is influenced by user roles such as Learner, Manager, and Learning Administrator, each with distinct permissions.
- Learners see assignments based on what administrators or managers assign or recommend through system configuration.
- Personalization settings allow:
  - Filtering of optional assignments by source (Manager Assignments vs Learning Team Assignments).
  - Interaction choices such as removing non-required items from visibility or bookmarking for later.
- Administrators can configure parameters affecting content delivery notably through Assignment Profiles, which determine automatic assignment rules and recommendations.
- Some settings impact user engagements with optional assignments, including enabling or disabling the "Remove" option and setting metadata flags that categorize an assignment as optional vs required.[1][3]

## User Workflows, Engagement Metrics, and Learner Experience Outcomes

- The typical workflow starts at the new Learning home page where required and optional curricula assignments are displayed distinctly.
- Learners can quickly assess what optional assignments might be beneficial, bookmark relevant items, or remove those not of interest, streamlining their learning journey.
- This reduces cognitive overload compared to the previous broader catalogs experience and encourages self-directed learning.
- Engagement metrics that can be tracked include:
  - Completion rates of optional assignments,
  - Frequency of bookmark use,
  - Rates of removal marking "not interested".
- Access through this direct interface is associated with improved learner satisfaction due to clearer next steps and personalized recommendations, contrasting with prior, more fragmented navigation methods.[8][1]

## Content Discovery and Filtering on the New Learning Home Page

- The "Important Learning" section includes robust filtering mechanisms that enable learners to sort optional learning by:
  - Content type (Course, Class, Program),
  - Assignment source (Manager or Administrator),
  - Relevance to roles or personal interests.
- Search functions support keyword queries across curriculum assignments.
- Categorization is enhanced by metadata tagging within curricula structures to separate optional and required items, supporting the system’s ability to highlight appropriate content dynamically.
- Sorting criteria favor relevance and deadline proximity, ensuring users see priority items effectively.
- The interface also features clear labeling and color codes to denote assignment types and statuses for intuitive navigation.[8][1]
