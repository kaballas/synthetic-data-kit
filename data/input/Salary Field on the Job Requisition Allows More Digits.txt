## 1. Technical Specifications and Limitations of Salary Input Field in SAP Recruiting and Recruiting Software

The salary input fields (Salary_Min, Salary_Mid, Salary_Max, Salary_Accepted) in SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting Management (RCM) traditionally have been configured with certain technical constraints to support storing and displaying salary information accurately.

- **Data Type:** Salary fields are typically numeric fields configured to accept decimal values to accommodate annual, monthly, or hourly salary units. The fields support floating point or decimal data formats to allow precision up to two decimal places.
- **Maximum Digit Capacity:** Until recently, the salary fields were restricted to standard integer or decimal sizes sufficient for typical salary ranges but limited for very high-value salaries or detailed fractional currency amounts. The default maximum digit capacity was around 9 to 10 digits including decimals.
- **Formatting Constraints:** Salary input fields include validation to enforce consistent currency format, use of commas as thousand separators depending on locale, and acceptance of decimal points for cents. Formatting is locale-sensitive to accommodate global currency formats.
- **Impact of Limits:** Limits on digit capacity previously could truncate or round very large salary values, affecting precise representation for senior executive, multinational roles or unusual currency denominations.

The recent update in SAP SuccessFactors has relaxed these digit limitations, now enabling more digits in salary fields, allowing more accurate and flexible salary data entries.[1]
