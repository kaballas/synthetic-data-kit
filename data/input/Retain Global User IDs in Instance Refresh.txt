## Comprehensive Report on Global User IDs and Instance Refresh in SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite

### Fundamental Concepts and Definitions of Global User IDs in SAP SuccessFactors

The Global User ID (GUID) is a stable, unique identifier designed to represent a user across all SAP business applications and cloud services, including SuccessFactors HCM Suite. Unlike traditional user IDs that may change based on usernames or email addresses, the global user ID remains consistent even if these attributes change, supporting persistent user identity linkage across disparate systems.[1][3]

The global user ID is a mutable but unique and case-sensitive string, typically in GUID format, allowing interoperability between SuccessFactors and broader SAP or third-party identity systems. It avoids using sensitive or easily changeable data such as email or personal names and is used predominantly in integration and single sign-on (SSO) scenarios.[3][1]

SAP uses various synonymous terms like UUID, user_uuid, or userUUID depending on context—such as SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) APIs, OpenID Connect tokens, or JSON payloads—but they denote the same conceptual identifier. The Global User ID acts as a semantic bridge, enabling system-wide consistent user identity management, critical for cross-system workflows like SAP Task Center and SAP Notification Service.[3]

This global identifier is often provisioned via SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication Service (IAS) or imported from third-party identity management tools using SCIM protocols, ensuring standardization and synchronization in multi-system SAP landscapes.[1][3]

### SAP SuccessFactors Instance Refresh Process and User Data Lifecycle

The instance refresh process in SAP SuccessFactors involves copying production or other source system data into a target instance, usually a test or development environment, to align data for accurate testing or training scenarios. This process typically includes user data, configuration, metadata, and transactional records.

Historically, during an instance refresh, the global user IDs were either cleared or deleted by default to prevent conflicts between user identities in the source and target instances, given unique user mappings and environmental differences. This clearing was to avoid linking user accounts incorrectly across instances, but it sometimes resulted in loss of relational integrity for identity-dependent integrations.[1]

The lifecycle of user data during instance refreshes involves extracting user records, transforming them (including resetting sensitive attributes such as passwords or IDs), and loading into the target instance. The default behavior with global user IDs often caused disruptions in testing services and integrations reliant on persistent user identity references.[1]

### Technical and Functional Implications of Clearing vs. Retaining Global User IDs

Clearing global user IDs during instance refresh ensures a clean separation between environments but breaks identity linkage, causing issues in integrations relying on user continuity (e.g., API access, workflow notifications, identity provisioning between IAS and SuccessFactors). This can lead to inconsistent user states and increased administrative overhead to re-establish identity mappings.[3][1]

Retaining global user IDs ensures consistent user identity across refreshed instances, preserving integration links and reducing reconfiguration efforts. However, this option introduces risks of data leakage or identity overlap if the target instance is not properly secured or isolated, potentially causing unauthorized access or compliance concerns.[3][1]

From a functional standpoint, retaining IDs simplifies activities such as role-based testing, API validation, and context-aware service execution, whereas clearing IDs often necessitates manual remapping or additional provisioning effort.[1]

### Configuration Options and the "Do Not Delete Global User IDs" Setting

SAP SuccessFactors now offers a specific configuration option in the instance refresh request settings labeled “Do not delete global user IDs.” This toggle can be found under the Specific Settings section during refresh request submission in the system management interface.

Enabling this option instructs the refresh process to retain all global user IDs intact rather than clearing them out, thus maintaining identity references across the source and target instances. This setting provides administrators control over identity preservation during refresh to fit the operational and security needs of their organization.[1]

The feature is managed via system-specific controls and subject to role-based permissions, ensuring only authorized admins can toggle this critical setting. SAP documentation highlights that this option must be explicitly requested as it deviates from the previous default of clearing IDs.[1]

### Use Cases, Best Practices, and Caveats for Retaining vs. Deleting Global User IDs

Use cases for retaining global user IDs include maintaining seamless integration testing, identity federation validation, and complex workflow testing environments where identity continuity is essential. This is beneficial in enterprises using identity services like SAP IAS or third-party providers aligned with SuccessFactors.[3]

Best practices emphasize:
- Ensuring strong data access controls on target instances since identity continuity can expose sensitive user links.
- Segregating production and non-production IAS tenants to avoid UUID conflicts.
- Rigorously validating user data consistency pre- and post-refresh.
- Consulting SAP Knowledge Base Articles and community discourse for environment-specific recommendations.[3][1]

Caveats include potential security risks if non-production environments retain real global user IDs without proper access demarcation and challenges in rollback or data anonymization due to persistent IDs.[3]

### Security, Compliance, and Access Management Implications

Retaining global user IDs impacts system security by maintaining persistent identity references that can lead to unauthorized cross-instance access if refresh target environments lack equivalent controls. Hence, compliance mandates require strict segregation of environments and proper audit trails when global user IDs are preserved during refresh.[1][3]

Deleting global user IDs on refresh minimizes these risks by isolating identities per environment but introduces operational challenges in managing identity re-provisioning and integration re-mapping.[1]

Enterprises must weigh their regulatory requirements, including GDPR and internal security policies, when deciding to retain or clear these identifiers.[3][1]

### SAP Formal Changes and Communications on Global User ID Handling

SAP has formally introduced the "Do not delete global user IDs" option in version updates post-2024, documented in official SAP SuccessFactors platform release notes and patch advisories. These communications stress the operational and security considerations and provide guidance on enabling the setting.[1]

SAP Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs) and official help documentation have been updated to reflect this option and its usage scenarios, accompanied by community webinars and technical blogs released through 2024-2025.[1]

### Handling Global User IDs Across Deployment Scenarios

Global user ID handling differs across cloud, hybrid, and regional implementations:
- Cloud-only SuccessFactors instances typically use IAS for centralized identity management where ID retention is critical.
- Hybrid deployments with on-premise integrations require careful synchronization to avoid ID conflicts.
- Regional data residency and privacy laws may influence how identities are stored and retained during refresh, necessitating custom configuration and validation.[3][1]

Administrators must consider deployment architecture when planning refreshes involving global user IDs to avoid integration failures or compliance breaches.

### Recommended Procedures and Validation Checks for Retaining Global User IDs

Procedural recommendations include:
- Executing pre-refresh audits of global user IDs and associated identity mappings.
- Validating role-based permissions for the instance refresh operation.
- Testing refresh on non-critical environments before production-scale refresh.
- Using SAP-provided check tools to verify user identity integrity post-refresh.
- Maintaining detailed logs of refresh operations and changes to global user ID retention settings to support traceability and rollback if needed.[3][1]

### Strategic Approach to Retaining Global User IDs in Instance Refresh Requests

Administrators should adopt a balanced approach:
- Assess operational benefits versus security/compliance risks.
- Engage with SAP support and review official documentation for the latest updates and recommendations.
- Customize instance refresh settings based on organizational identity federation maturity and environment isolation.
- Incorporate governance policies around identity management in refresh planning.
- Prioritize environment segregation, access control, and data protection to mitigate risks when retaining global user IDs.[3][1]
