## Overview of Current Functionalities, Structures, and User Interfaces of Custom Cards and Custom Pages in SAP Learning Administration

Custom Cards and Custom Pages are key components of the new Learning home page experience in SAP Learning Administration as of the latest updates in late 2024 and early 2025.[1][9]

- **Custom Cards:**
  - Appear in their own dedicated section on the Learning home page.
  - Administrators can create up to 100 custom cards.
  - From a learner perspective, up to 8 cards are displayed, filtered based on date, status, and organizational or user group belonging.
  - Cards show a title, subtitle, and optionally an image.
  - Cards can function either as links (to internal/external URLs, JavaScript URLs, email) or dialogs.
  - Dialog cards support embedding HTML, videos, iFrames, formatted rich text with multiple links and images, and partner integrations.
  - Visibility is highly configurable targeting all users or selected organizations/user groups, supporting suborganization inclusion.
  - Cards have customizable active periods and can be set to always active.
  - Administrators can reorder cards using drag-and-drop or a move-in-list function.
  - The custom cards section appears by default below the "Requests for Me" section but can be repositioned.

- **Custom Pages:**
  - Custom Pages let administrators build comprehensive learning zones on the homepage.
  - Each page supports up to 5 banners and up to 6 sections.
  - Each section can contain up to 8 custom cards.
  - This layering allows tailored grouping of content and messaging directed at specific audiences or objectives.
  - Pages are designed to create distraction-free, audience-aligned learning hubs such as compliance academies, leadership areas, or onboarding zones.
  - The design is meant to support relevance and ease of navigation in the learning environment.[5][8][9]

The user interface in Learning Administration provides a centralized page to manage cards and pages, including adding, editing, deleting, and organizing elements with preview capabilities. Cards and pages are manageable with intuitive controls for visibility, targeting, and content type.

## Comparison with Competing Learning Management Systems and SAP Solutions

Competitive LMS and broader SAP solutions show varying degrees of customization and user experience around dynamic homepage content:

| Feature Aspect                | SAP Learning Custom Cards/Pages                        | Competitor LMS (e.g., Cornerstone, Docebo)               | Other SAP Solutions (e.g., SAP Enable Now)                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Custom Card Count            | Up to 100 cards, 5 pages with multiple banners/sections| Generally fewer dashboard widgets but with deep analytics | Focus more on guided learning, less on dynamic cards       |
| Target Audience Filtering     | Organization, user groups, time-based activation      | Role-based filtering common; may lack suborg flexibility | User profiles and roles drive content, less granular control|
| Content Types Supported       | HTML, iFrame, video, JS, email links                   | Highly varied; may support advanced SCORM/xAPI content   | Primarily microlearning and documentation content          |
| Admin UI Flexibility          | Drag-drop, filters, expiration indicators              | Dashboard editing often less flexible or more complex     | Guided content creation through templates                   |
| Integration with External Tools| LinkedIn Learning, SharePoint, 3rd party embeds        | Extensive marketplace options, but vary by vendor         | Closely tied to SAP ecosystem, less open to external LMS   |
| Personalization and AI       | Skill-driven and target-group-based display             | Advanced AI-driven recommendations available              | Contextual help but less AI-driven content personalization  |

SAP Learning Administration's Custom Cards and Pages excel in integrating structured organizational context with adaptive presentation. However, competitors may offer richer analytics or AI-driven personalizations, suggesting potential growth areas for SAP.[7][5]

## Best Practices, User Feedback, and Case Studies from Administrators

Documented administrator practices emphasize:

- **Strategic Grouping:** Using Custom Pages to segment major learner populations (by department, role, or learning objective) for targeted relevance.
- **Time-based Campaigns:** Leveraging active period settings to promote timely learning events (e.g., annual compliance weeks).
- **Rich Media Use:** Embedding videos and interactive HTML to increase engagement.
- **Consistent Maintenance:** Regularly using the expiration indicators and filters to archive outdated cards and keep the homepage fresh.
- **Leveraging Partner Integrations:** Including external resources enriches content variety and aligns with organizational learning strategy.

Case studies highlight improved learner engagement and satisfaction, with administrators noting how the personalization and dynamic updates encourage continuous user interaction and reduce information overload.[5][7]

## Challenges, Limitations, and Common Pitfalls Post-Enhancement

Despite improvements, some challenges remain:

- **Performance Concerns:** Overloading with too many cards or heavy media can slow page load times.
- **User Adoption:** Learners occasionally overlook cards, requiring ongoing communication to enhance visibility.
- **Complexity in Large Enterprises:** Managing visibility across many org units and suborgs can become administratively heavy.
- **Content Freshness:** Without strict governance, cards may expire unnoticed if filters are not used.
- **Design Constraints:** Fixed limits on cards per section and pages can restrict expansive campaigns.

Administrators report a learning curve in mastering filters and configurations but appreciate enhanced UI tools for reducing errors and oversight.[10][7]
