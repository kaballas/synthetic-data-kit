## What Is the Succession Org Chart in Succession Planning and the Role of Individual Positions/Profiles?

The Succession Org Chart (SOC) is the central hierarchical visualization and management interface within broader Succession Planning. It shows the reporting relationships between roles, positions, and employees across an organization. As such, it represents the “organizational view” of succession readiness, numbering incumbents, potential successors, and open positions within a structured tree or graph framework.

### Key Roles of Positions and Profiles in the SOC
- **Positions:** They define structured roles or jobs in the organization's hierarchy. Each position acts as a node within the SOC and may have incumbents (current holders).
- **Profiles (People/Incumbents):** These are individual talent profiles linked to incumbents or succession candidates. Profiles provide talent details, competencies, readiness, and development plans essential for succession decisions.
- **Succession Candidates:** The SOC lets you view direct succession options per position, placing high-potential candidates in visual relationship with key roles.
- **Critical Role Identification:** The SOC enables organizations to identify, prioritize, and focus succession efforts on critical roles key to business continuity.

The SOC thus serves as both a tactical visualization and operational tool, connecting hierarchical organizational structure with talent data to guide succession decisions and talent development strategies. It supports transparency, future-proofing leadership pipelines, and mitigating risks of vacancies or talent gaps.[8][1][3]

## Standard Functionalities of the Succession Org Chart in SAP Career and Talent Development

SAP’s SOC, particularly in SuccessFactors Succession & Development modules, offers the following key functionalities:

- **Hierarchical Navigation:** Lays out reporting lines through positions and incumbents for multiple organizational levels.
- **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for any position or person and jump directly to their reporting line within the org chart.
- **Position & Talent Cards:** Embedded detailed cards show position information (title, incumbents, successors) and talent profiles, offering side-by-side comparisons of successors.
- **Visual Indicators for Talent Attributes:** Icons and color codes represent attributes such as bench strength, potential, readiness, displayed compactly to avoid clutter.
- **Dynamic Layouts:** The org chart adjusts between horizontal and compact vertical modes based on team size or user navigation behavior, optimizing screen space and clarity.
- **Integration with Development Planning:** Direct links from succession profiles to development plans ensure continuity from succession readiness to talent growth.
- **Role-based Data Security:** Data visibility within the SOC strictly follows role-based permissions and target population configurations, securing sensitive talent and succession data.
- **Modern UI Standards:** The latest SOC version aligns with SAP Fiori user experience standards, offering responsiveness, fast interactions, and no dependency on outdated technologies like Flash.[3]

These functionalities empower Talent and Succession managers to holistically review and manage succession plans embedded within organizational team structures.[5][3]

## Technical and UI Features Governing Hiding and Unhiding of Positions or Profiles in SOC

Visibility management in SOC is governed around these layers:

- **Role-Based Permissions:** Defined in Manage Permission Roles, these control who can view, nominate, and modify succession information in the SOC. Important permissions include:
  - *Succession Org Chart Permission* – access to view the SOC itself
  - *Succession Planning Permission* – to nominate successors and see pending nominations
  - *Succession Management and Matrix Report Permissions* – controls viewing of successors and incumbents within target populations

- **Target Populations:** These define specific employee groups or organizational units relevant for permission scopes. Visibility of positions and successors is only granted if individuals fall within the user’s assigned target population.

- **Position/Incumbent Status:** Positions or profiles can be hidden based on organizational rules, leaving out inactive, obsolete, or confidential roles from typical SOC views.

- **Configuration Files (XML):** SOC node display information, including icons or labels indicating visibility status, is often controlled via XML provisioning files that instruct how data is displayed per node.

- **UI Controls:** Admin portals and SOC user interfaces have limited controls that allow authorized users to toggle visibility, but major visibility changes require administrative permission and configuration changes.

- **Data Synchronization:** Changes to visibility are managed through backend processes that synchronize data between SAP HCM, SuccessFactors, and other integrated modules, which may introduce short delays before visibility changes take full effect.[9][3][5]

***

## Documented Methods and Conditions to Unhide Positions or Profiles in SOC and Impact on Organizational Visibility

Unhiding previously hidden positions or profiles involves:

1. **Identifying Cause of Hidden Status:**
   - Whether the position or profile is hidden due to target population exclusion, permission restrictions, configuration settings, or data synchronization issues.

2. **Permissions and Target Population Update:**
   - Admins update permission roles to include the user or user group in the relevant target populations that permit visibility of those positions/profiles.
   - This involves reviewing Manage Permission Roles and Succession Planning target populations.

3. **Configuration Adjustments:**
   - For icon or display elements configured in the SOC XML, adjustments may be necessary to ensure nodes become visible upon unhiding.

4. **Refreshing Succession Planning Data:**
   - Running data synchronization jobs or reloading relevant caches to ensure backend changes reflect in the SOC UI.

5. **Propagated Visibility:**
   - Changes affect the org chart view at all organizational levels where the position/profile appears, influencing the display for all users with access.

6. **Role Assignment and Matrix Permissions:**
   - Ensuring the users have the associated roles and permissions that allow them to see the now unhidden positions or profiles.

These methods generally require administrative or consultant roles with adequate system access.[3][5][9]

***

## Impact of Unhiding on Data Integrity, User Experience, Role-Based Access, and Reporting

- **Data Integrity:**
  - Changes in visibility do not alter the underlying data but affect the data exposed to users.
  - Maintaining strict role-based access ensures no unauthorized data leakage occurs during or after unhiding.

- **User Experience:**
  - Users with expanded visibility gain a fuller picture of succession pipelines, improving decision-making ability.
  - UI consistency and fewer gaps in the org chart smooth navigation and reduce confusion.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Unhiding defaults to aligned RBAC controls—users must have explicit permissions for viewing.
  - Discrepancies between permissions and target populations cause visibility inconsistencies.

- **Reporting Outputs:**
  - Reports based on SOC data dynamically reflect visibility changes.
  - Inclusion of unhidden profiles may affect analytics metrics such as bench strength, succession readiness, or talent pool sizes.

A disciplined, documented process for unhiding ensures data governance and delivers an improved, accurate talent and succession overview.[5][3]
