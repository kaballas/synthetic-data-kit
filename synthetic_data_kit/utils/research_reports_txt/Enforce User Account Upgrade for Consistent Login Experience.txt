## Core Differences Between Employment-Based and Account-Based Logins in SAP SuccessFactors

### Definitions and Concepts

- **Employment-Based Logins**: These login models authenticate users based on employment records stored within SAP SuccessFactors' Employee Central or HR system. Users are identified and granted access tied specifically to their employment status—i.e., they are employees with an active record in the system. The login credentials and related identity attributes are directly linked to the employment data.

- **Account-Based Logins**: Account-based logins abstract the user identity from direct employment records, instead linking authentication to a distinct user account entity which may serve multiple purposes beyond employment, allowing a more flexible and consistent user experience. This model supports unified identities independent of the employment lifecycle and supports integration with external identity providers or SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS).

### Technical Frameworks

- Employment-based logins are traditionally based on the employees' personal and job information within SuccessFactors Employee Central. The user's identity is tied to employment attributes such as Employee ID, hire dates, and employment status.

- Account-based logins rely on a system-managed login account that represents a person as a user entity separate from employment details. This account may link to multiple person objects (employment records) but retains a persistent login identity. It may be integrated with SAP IAS or other external authentication services.

### Typical Use Cases

- Employment-based logins are typically for internal employees requiring access tightly coupled with their employment data lifecycle—hire, transfer, termination.

- Account-based logins are used when organizations require a consistent, long-term identity that transcends employment changes, enabling smoother integrations with external identity systems, flexible identity federation, external collaborators, contractors, and compliance with evolving security standards.

***

## Technical Implementation and Management of User Authentication and Identity Linkage

### Data Structures and Identity Model

- Employment-based login data is directly linked to the **Employee Central** database where the person, user, and employment records reside. Identity linkage is managed through the **Employee ID** and associated employment metadata.

- Account-based login introduces a **login account entity** separate from the employee record. This account stores authentication credentials and links to one or more person records. The SAP SuccessFactors platform manages this via enhanced **user and login account tables** that support multi-tenant, multi-identity frameworks.

### Authorization Mechanisms

- Employment-based logins enforce authorization based on HR roles and employment attributes. Permission systems rely on job roles, organizational assignments, and active employment status.

- Account-based logins employ role-based access controls linked to user accounts combined with broader identity federation and single sign-on (SSO) frameworks via SAP IAS or integration with third-party IAM providers.

### Integration Points

- Employment-based authentication is internally managed within SuccessFactors modules with limited external identity federation.

- Account-based login supports integration with SAP IAS, OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, and OpenID Connect for federated identity, enabling SSO and external identity provider support. This allows seamless user authentication across multiple SAP and non-SAP applications.

***

## Motivations for Upgrading from Employment-Based to Account-Based Logins

- **Security**: Account-based logins leverage modern authentication protocols and centralized identity services (like SAP IAS) with multi-factor authentication, conditional access policies, and stronger identity management features.

- **User Experience**: Upgrading to account-based logins delivers a consistent sign-in experience, supports SSO, reduces password fatigue, and unifies identities across systems.

- **Compliance**: Adopting account-based models aligns with regulations requiring stronger identity proofing, audit capabilities, privacy protections, and cross-system identity management.

- **Technical Modernization**: Employment-based logins may face limitations handling external users, contractors, or complex identity workflows which account-based logins are designed to support.

- **Smooth Integration**: Account-based login is mandatory for full integration with SAP IAS, which is the strategic identity provider solution for SuccessFactors customers going forward.

## System-Level Upgrade Process from Employment to Account-Based Logins

### Overview

- SAP provides a formalized process to upgrade users from employment-based logins (PWD login method) to account-based logins to achieve a consistent login experience across an instance.

### Steps and Triggers

1. **Enabling the Upgrade**: Administrators activate the "Enforce user account upgrade" option in the SuccessFactors user management settings.

2. **Identification and Preparation**: The system scans existing employment-based login users and prepares account-based login entities.

3. **User Account Creation**: New login accounts are provisioned or linked to existing employment records.

4. **Data Synchronization**: Identity attributes and credentials from employment-based entries are migrated or linked to the new account-based models.

5. **User Transition**: When users next authenticate, they begin using their new account-based login credentials.

6. **Monitoring and Validation**: System administrators monitor the migration for errors, access issues, and user feedback.

### Conditions and Criteria

- Available only for instances using the PWD login method with employment-based logins.

- Upgrade is typically manual or scheduled by administrators and can be phased to reduce impact.

### Challenges and Mitigation

- Identity attribute mismatches, data duplication, synchronization latency.

- User confusion due to changed login credentials or behavior.

- Legacy system compatibility issues.

Mitigation includes clear communications to users, phased rollouts, and administrator training supported by SAP documentation.

## Changes in User Profile Display After Upgrade

- Post-upgrade, user identification shifts from employment-centric names to system login names.

- The **username field replaces the display of user names** in login screens and user administration interfaces.

- This impacts how users are identified and navigated within the system, emphasizing consistent login identity over employment context.

- System administration benefits from unified user identifiers but needs adjustments in user management workflows and reporting.

***

## Risks, Limitations, and Pitfalls of Enforcing Account Upgrades

- **Legacy System Compatibility**: Some integrations or extensions may rely on employment-based identifiers that break after upgrade.

- **Data Consistency**: Potential for mismatches or duplication between old and new identity data records.

- **User Confusion**: Change in login identifiers and workflows can cause access issues or support tickets.

- **Support Challenges**: Increased helpdesk workload during transition; need for detailed troubleshooting and training.

- **Compliance Risks**: Incomplete upgrades or mismanaged data may cause privacy or audit issues.

***

## Practical Handling of User Transition by Customers and Administrators

- Documented best practices include: 

  - Phased rollouts with pilot user groups.
  
  - Comprehensive user communication plans explaining the change and impact.
  
  - Training sessions for administrators and end-users.
  
  - Use of SAP-provided tools and diagnostics for monitoring upgrade success.
  
  - Creation of fallback plans allowing rollback or support escalation.
  
  - Collecting user feedback to refine rollout.
