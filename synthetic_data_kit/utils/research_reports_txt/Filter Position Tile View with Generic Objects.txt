# Extremely Detailed Report on Generic Objects and Position Tile View Filtering in SAP SuccessFactors Succession Planning and Career & Talent Development

## 1. What are "Generic Objects" in SAP SuccessFactors?

In SAP SuccessFactors, particularly within Succession Planning and Career & Talent Development, Generic Objects are extensible data objects outside the standard entity models (like employees or positions). Generic Objects allow customers to define, create, and manage custom data objects that can represent various additional business entities such as projects, certifications, or equipment linked to talent management processes.

- **Definition**: A Generic Object typically encapsulates attribute collections configured via Metadata Framework (MDF). It can include custom fields tailored to extend SuccessFactors modules.
- **Creation**: Admins create Generic Objects using the Metadata Framework, enabling the deployment of new object types with customizable fields, workflows, and UI elements.
- **Categorization**: These objects are categorized by their business domain and relationship to core objects. For example, a "Certification" Generic Object can be linked to an employee profile for talent development tracking.
- Generic Objects are integral to the extensible architecture of SAP SuccessFactors, enabling organizations to tailor solutions to specific needs without altering core system schemas.

## 2. How does the Position Tile view function within Succession Planning and Succession & Development?

The Position Tile view offers an alternative to hierarchical org charts by displaying positions in a tile-based layout for succession planning.

- **Functionality**: It allows succession planners to visually manage succession plans by selecting positions as tiles. Each tile can show job title, job level, department, and succession-related metadata.
- **Data Display**: Typically shows position attributes, incumbents (if any), successors, and readiness ratings.
- **Filters before Generic Object filtering**: Users could filter by position attributes such as department, job level, and other standard organizational attributes. Filters enabled planners to narrow down positions based on predefined parameters but were limited to standard attributes tied directly to the position or employee.

## 3. Technical architecture and data flow of filtering in the Position Tile view

- **Data Model**: Position data resides in MDF Position objects, aligned with organizational structures.
- **Filter Attributes Configuration**: Admins configure filter attributes in the Provisioning environment and Succession Org Chart Configuration UI. Filters use metadata definitions mapped to position attributes.
- **Filtering Logic Execution**: When a user applies a filter in the UI, the system triggers backend queries against MDF Position objects using OData or other APIs. Filter parameters are passed to the backend service layer, which fetches and returns filtered results.
- Filtering is executed in near real-time, enabling an interactive experience for planners. Position and succession plan data are aggregated and shown as tiles once filtering criteria are applied.

## 4. Integration of Generic Objects into Position Tile filtering

- **Support**: Recent updates have integrated Generic Object filtering into the Position Tile view, meaning planners can filter positions based on linked Generic Objects.
- **Supported Generic Objects**: These include objects linked via MDF to positions, such as certifications, projects, competencies, or any custom object relevant to succession/talent.
- **Filter Criteria and Attributes**: Attributes from Generic Objects—such as certification expiry dates, project involvement status, or competency levels—can be used as filter parameters to narrow down positions.
- This integration unlocks enhanced granularity, allowing business-specific dimensions to refine succession views beyond traditional org structure attributes.

## 5. Use cases driving filtering Positions by Generic Objects

- **Talent Eligibility Tracking**: Filtering positions to show only those where successors have specific certifications or qualifications.
- **Project-based Succession Planning**: For positions tied to projects, filtering to review successors involved in relevant projects via Project Generic Object.
- **Compliance and Readiness Assessments**: Quickly identifying positions with successors missing required Generic Object-based attributes (e.g., mandatory training).
- These scenarios enable strategic alignment between talent capacities and business needs, boosting workforce agility and personalized development paths.

## 6. Best practices, configuration steps, and permissions setup

- **Configuration Steps**:
    - Create and define relevant Generic Objects and attributes in MDF.
    - Link Generic Objects to Position objects or successors logically.
    - Enable Position Tile view and Generic Object filter feature via Provisioning and Admin Center settings.
    - Configure the filterable Generic Object attributes in the Succession Org Chart Configuration screens.
- **Permissions**: Position Tile view and filtering require Position-level permissions assigned via Role-Based Permissions (RBP). Access to Generic Object data for filtering also needs proper permissions.
- **Limitations/Caveats**:
    - Filtering complexity may increase query times.
    - Only Generic Objects linked to Positions with properly configured relations are supported.
    - Ensure data completeness and quality in Generic Objects for reliable filtering.
- Dependencies exist on MDF framework capabilities and system release versions.

## 7. Impact on performance, user experience, and data accuracy; SAP monitoring/troubleshooting

- **Performance**: Filtering on Generic Objects adds additional backend query load since multiple MDF tables must be joined. SAP recommends limiting filter scope and optimizing object definitions.
- **User Experience**: The flexible filters enhance discoverability but must be intuitive and supported by clear UI labeling.
- **Data Accuracy**: Relies on data integrity in the Generic Objects and linkage configuration.
- **Monitoring**: SAP SuccessFactors provides monitoring tools for API query performance and error logs to troubleshoot slow or failed filters.
- Administrators should review usage patterns and optimize filter attributes periodically.

| Performance                   | Potentially higher query load            | Lower                                     | Moderate                                |
| Business Use Cases            | Highly customizable                      | Standard succession planning needs         | Standard organizational views           |

The Generic Object filtering introduces significant flexibility with some performance trade-offs compared to older capabilities.
