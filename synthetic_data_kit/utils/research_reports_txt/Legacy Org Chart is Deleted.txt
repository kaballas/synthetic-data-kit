# Detailed Report: Transition from Legacy to Automated Organizational Charts in SAP Platforms

## 1. Definitions, Core Functionalities, and Use Cases

### Legacy Organizational Charts in SAP

Legacy organizational charts in SAP platforms traditionally serve as graphical representations of an enterprise’s hierarchical reporting structure. They provide a static or semi-dynamic view often reliant on pre-defined, manual updates from HR or administrative users. Core functionalities include displaying reporting lines, employee positions, and departmental relationships in hierarchical tree formats.

Typical use cases:
- Visualizing manager-subordinate relationships.
- Organizing employee data for HR reporting.
- Supporting basic organizational navigation.
- Used mainly in older SAP HR modules or earlier SuccessFactors versions.

However, these legacy charts usually lack real-time updates, limited integration, and customization flexibility, often requiring manual maintenance and suffering from data latency issues.

### Modern Automated Organizational Charts in SAP

The automated organizational chart introduced by SAP, released incrementally since 1H 2024 and enabled universally by 1H 2025, represents a modernized, dynamic, and user-friendly tool tightly integrated across SAP’s cloud HCM (Human Capital Management) platform and other modules.

Core functionalities include:
- Dynamic, real-time updates with integration to live employee master data.
- Support for complex reporting relationships including matrix and dotted-line reporting.
- Customizable organizational views with drag-and-drop reordering of reports.
- Inclusion of multiple reporting lines (e.g., matrix managers).
- Search history and intelligent navigation functions.
- Mobile and web adaptations for ease of access across devices.
- Self-service additions such as direct employee addition via org chart interface.

Use cases have expanded substantially:
- Real-time organizational transparency and navigation.
- Operational HR management including workforce planning.
- Integrated support for payroll, reporting, and analytics.
- Enabling agile organizational change management.
- Supporting compliance and audit transparency via updated org records.

The automated org chart is embedded deeply into SAP SuccessFactors’ Employee Central and other HR modules, promoting a seamless user experience with broad organizational contexts beyond simple hierarchical displays.[1][5][10]
