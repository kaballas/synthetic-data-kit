This report provides an extensive analysis of the Accrual Recalculation Posting Method "Classic" within SAP Employee Central Time Management (ECTM), covering its core design, historical context, planned deprecation, alternatives, customer responses, technical impacts, best practices for migration, lessons from past deprecations, and a comprehensive outlook to guide users in strategic transition planning.

## Core Functionalities, Design, and Role of the Accrual Recalculation Posting Method "Classic"

The Accrual Recalculation Posting Method "Classic" in SAP Employee Central Time Management is a mechanism used to handle the recalculation of accrued time balances—such as vacation or leave entitlements—when changes occur that affect these balances (e.g., changes in employee job information like FTE, weekly hours, eligibility).

### Design Principles
- **Triple Posting per Recalculation**: Under the Classic method, for each accrual period during recalculation, the system posts three separate entries to the time account:
  1. The original accrual value is posted.
  2. A reversal posting is made to set the original accrual back to zero.
  3. The newly calculated accrual value is posted.
- This approach helps to keep recalculations balanced, ensuring the time account reflects the latest, accurate accrual amount after any changes.
- The method is recalculation-neutral in terms of balance—each set of postings for an accrual period ultimately results in an updated balance reflecting new calculations.

### Role within Time and Attendance Management
- It supports automatic and manual recalculations triggered by changes in employee attributes that affect accruals.
- Allows tracking detailed accrual history as each recalculation generates multiple postings, preserving audit trails of how accrual balances evolved.
- Integral for compliance and accuracy in payroll and time valuation scenarios, especially when employee conditions affecting accrual semantics vary over time.

***

## Historical Development, Adoption, and Industry Usage up to May 2025

- The Classic method represents the original and long-standing approach for accrual recalculation in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Time Off and Time Management modules, used widely across various industries where precise time management is critical (manufacturing, retail, services, public sector, etc.).
- Adoption was nearly universal for new Time Account Types created before 1H 2020.
- Since the introduction of SAP Employee Central Time Management revisions, particularly after the 1H 2020 release, the "No Recalculation Postings" method was introduced as a modern alternative to address Classic's performance and data volume issues.
- Over time, SAP has shifted recommendations toward this newer method because Classic's posting volume and complexity negatively impacted system performance, especially in cases of daily accruals or frequent recalculations.

***

## SAP Official Roadmap, Deprecation, and Reasons

- **End of Development**: May 2025 (1H 2025 release).
- **End of Maintenance and Final Deletion**: Scheduled for December 2025.
- As part of the 1H 2025 SAP SuccessFactors release waves, the Classic Accrual Recalculation Posting Method is officially deprecated and will be completely removed from Time Account Types.
- **Reasons for Deprecation**:
  - **Performance**: Classic method generates excessive data volume by posting three entries per recalculation per accrual period, leading to degraded system performance.
  - **Data Redundancy**: Duplication of accrual entries adds complexity and storage burden.
  - **Insufficient Handling of Date Changes**: The Classic method only accounted for changes in quantity, not for changes in accrual posting dates, limiting recalculation accuracy.
  - **Advantage of Alternatives**: The "No Recalculation Postings" method overcomes these issues by making single update postings, automatically cleaning up duplicates, and considering date changes.
- All existing Time Account Types using Classic will be automatically migrated to "No Recalculation Postings" starting with the 1H 2025 release.

***

## Alternative Accrual Posting Methods Recommended by SAP

- The primary successor is the **No Recalculation Postings** method, introduced since 1H 2020.
- **Technical Differences**:
  - Only one posting per accrual period is made, where the original accrual posting is updated directly rather than posted and reversed multiple times.
  - Automatically handles cleanup of duplicated accrual postings.
  - Considers both quantity and date changes during recalculation, enhancing accuracy.
  - Reduces data volume significantly, especially beneficial for daily accrual scenarios.
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved system performance with lower data storage needs.
  - More accurate recalculation outcomes considering posting date shifts.
  - Streamlined account postings simplify audit and reconciliation processes.
- **Potential Limitations**:
  - Some legacy customer-specific scenarios might require rule adjustments to fully leverage this method.
  - Organizations need to validate business rules and integration setups during migration to prevent unexpected recalculation results.

***

## Customer, Partner, and Consultant Preparedness and Responses

- SAP customers and partners have largely embraced "No Recalculation Postings" for new deployments from 2020 onward.
- Migration from Classic has been mandatory for existing clients starting with the 1H 2025 release.
- **Migration Strategies**:
  - SAP provides automatic migration tools and extensive documentation.
  - Customers are advised to review and update Time Management Configuration and Time Account Type settings before migration.
  - Pilot projects and early adopters report the need for comprehensive testing around accrual rule recalculations and payroll integration.
- **Documented Challenges**:
  - Handling legacy customization and rule dependencies linked to Classic method intricacies.
  - Training HR and payroll teams for understanding the new recalculation flow.
  - Managing temporary discrepancies during transition phases related to balance recalculations.
- Case studies from consulting partners emphasize the importance of phased migration, thorough validation, and close collaboration with SAP support.

***

## Technical and Operational Impacts Expected from Complete Removal

- **Integration**:
  - Simplification as fewer, clearer postings reduce integration errors with payroll systems and external interfaces.
- **Data Accuracy**:
  - Enhanced accuracy in accrual postings by considering date and quantity changes consistently.
- **Payroll Processes**:
  - Reduced risk of duplicate entries causing payroll miscalculations.
  - Payroll systems must adapt to changed posting structure; testing is crucial.
- **Time Valuation and Compliance**:
  - Maintaining compliance with labor laws and internal policies via precise accrual recalculations.
  - Better audit trails and reporting due to reduced complexity.
- Organizations must recalibrate downstream processes and reports consuming time account data.

***

## Best Practices, Tools, and SAP Support for Transition

- Review current Time Account Types and identify all using Classic method.
- Communicate timeline and impacts with HR, payroll, and IT teams early.
- Use SAP-delivered migration tools and automatic updates included in 1H 2025 release.
- Conduct end-to-end testing in sandbox or test environments covering accrual calculations, recalculations after job info changes, and payroll integration scenarios.
- Update business rules and recalculation fields to align with the new posting logic.
- Utilize SAP Enablement and support resources such as:
  - SAP SuccessFactors Community forums.
  - Official SAP implementation and upgrade guides.
