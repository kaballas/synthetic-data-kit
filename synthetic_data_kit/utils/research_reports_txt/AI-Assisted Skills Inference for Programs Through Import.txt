I have found some relevant sources to deeply address the first question and parts of the others related to AI-assisted skills inference in SAP Learning environments. I will now gather targeted information specifically about:

- Fundamental concepts, definitions, use cases, and traditional vs AI-enhanced skills inference in digital learning, especially in SAP Learning
- Technical frameworks, machine learning models, data inputs, algorithms SAP uses for AI-assisted skills inference
- Mechanisms of bulk skill association with learning programs via import in SAP systems
- Operational benefits, challenges, limitations of bulk skill association in SAP Learning

I will start by systematically compiling detailed information on these aspects from the top relevant sources obtained.I will now fetch the detailed content from these key URLs that seem to contain official SAP documentation and in-depth details on AI-assisted skills inference and bulk skill associations:
