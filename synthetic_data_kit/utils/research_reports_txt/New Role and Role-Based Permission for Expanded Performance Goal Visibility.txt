Starting with the research on the Extended EH role and related Role-Based Permissions (RBP) in SAP’s Goal Management, findings answer the detailed questions comprehensively.

## 1. Core Functionalities and Typical Use Cases of Goal Management in SAP Performance & Goals

SAP’s Goal Management module within the Performance & Goals product provides a structured framework to set, track, and align employee and organizational goals. Typical functionalities include creating individual and team goals, cascading goals down the hierarchy, enabling managers and employees to update goals, and integrating goals into performance evaluation cycles.

Use cases include:
- Enabling alignment of employee goals with strategic company objectives.
- Facilitating continuous performance management through goal tracking.
- Supporting managers and HR in monitoring and coaching employee progress.
- Providing visibility to managers over direct reports’ goals and enabling updates and reviews.

Roles and permissions typically include:
- Employee: can set and update own goals.
- Manager: can view/update goals of direct reports.
- Employee Hierarchy (EH): role enabling managers and HR to access goals of employees in their hierarchy.
- HR and Admin roles with broader visibility and editing rights.

These roles are configured through Role-Based Permissions (RBP) controlling visibility, editing rights, and action permissions per goal plan and organizational structure.

## 2. Definition, Purpose, and Technical Scope of the Extended EH Role

The Extended EH (Employee Hierarchy) role is a newly introduced enhancement in SAP Goal Management designed to extend access beyond direct-report relationships. The defining purpose is to provide broader, more flexible access to performance goals for HR users and talent administrators who need to oversee and support goal achievement across a wider range of employees beyond traditional managerial hierarchies.

Technically, the Extended EH role builds on the existing EH role but allows permissions to be based on any target population relationship defined in Role-Based Permissions (RBP), instead of only employee-manager relationships. This means access rights can be assigned dynamically through RBP configurations to broader user groups within the organization.

The Extended EH role must be explicitly configured in the goal plan template alongside the traditional EH role. Its activation depends on this configuration and assignment of the new RBP permission "Extended EH for Performance Goals."

## 3. Detailed Specifications and Capabilities of the "Extended EH for Performance Goals" RBP

The new permission, "Extended EH for Performance Goals," is a role-based permission that expands access control for performance goals visibility and editing:

- It is assignable through Manage Permission Roles in the Administrator Permissions under Manage Goals.
- Allows HR and designated users who are not EH in the traditional sense to access goals across a defined target population.
- Integrates with the Extended EH role configured in goal templates, mimicking EH role permissions but for a broader target group.
- Access is defined via target population relationships in RBP, allowing customization and flexibility per organizational needs.
- Grants read and edit permissions conforming to the EH role’s standard capabilities.
- Does not create a new role in the system but modifies the scope of permissions granted to assigned users.

## 4. Impact on User Visibility and Interaction with Performance Goals

By introducing the Extended EH role and its RBP counterpart, visibility to goals at various hierarchy levels is significantly enhanced:

- Users assigned Extended EH permissions can view and update goals for employees beyond their direct or indirect reports.
- Enables HR leaders and talent administrators to have an enterprise-wide or function-wide goal visibility, enabling proactive management.
- Managers with this role gain expanded oversight, facilitating comprehensive performance reviews and goal alignment sessions.
- Reporting and analytics can leverage this expanded access for more complete data coverage.
- Goal updates and managerial cascades work seamlessly, as users operating under Extended EH permissions maintain the rights to act on goals similarly to those with EH roles.
- Enhances collaboration and support mechanisms across cross-functional or matrix organizations.

## 5. Architectural and Security Considerations

Deploying Extended EH role and its RBP permission involves critical architectural and security considerations:

- **Access Control:** Must ensure that broader visibility does not violate data privacy or compliance rules like GDPR. Permission assignments must be carefully governed.
- **Segmentation:** The use of target population relationships allows fine-tuned access but requires accurate population definitions.
- **Audit and Compliance:** Expanded visibility should be logged with audit trails to monitor who accessed or edited goals.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Broader access increases exposure risk; role assignments should follow least privilege principles.
- **Performance:** Expanded queries across larger populations could impact system performance—optimizations should consider indexing and caching.
- **Scalability:** System architecture must accommodate flexible role relationships and dynamic permission assignments.

## 6. Implementation, Configuration, and Best Practices

Organizations implement the Extended EH role and RBP permission by:

- Enabling the latest Goal Management version where the feature is available.
- Configuring EH roles within goal plan templates and then adding Extended EH roles for specific templates.
- Assigning the Extended EH for Performance Goals permission to HR users and talent administrators via Manage Permissions Roles.
- Defining target populations carefully in RBP to match organizational units or custom groupings.
- Testing visibility with pilot groups before full rollout.
- Monitoring usage and refining target populations to avoid excessive access.
- Avoiding overlap with traditional EH roles to maintain clear permission boundaries.
- Documenting role assignments and incorporating them into governance frameworks.

## 7. Measuring Effectiveness and User Impact

Metrics and methodologies to gauge the Extended EH role’s effectiveness include:

- User surveys and feedback from HR and management on ease of goal visibility and management.
- Usage analytics tracking the volume and breadth of goal accesses and edits by Extended EH users.
- Performance review cycle improvements, such as reduced delays or enhanced goal alignment rates.
- Comparing error rates or permission issues before and after implementation.
- Monitoring compliance adherence and audit results for unauthorized access attempts.
- Benchmarking against previous permissions to assess expanded visibility benefits.

## 8. Comparison with Other Performance Management Systems

Compared to other leading HR and performance management platforms:

| Feature                         | SAP Extended EH Role                        | Other Systems (e.g., Workday, Oracle HCM)             |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Scope                    | Flexible target population-based access   | Often strict hierarchy-based visibility               |
| Role-Based Permission Framework | Yes, integrated with RBP for fine control | Yes, but varies in granularity and flexibility        |
| User Control                   | Can assign per goal plan template          | Generally system-wide or per module assignment        |
| Visibility for HR & Admin       | Broad enterprise-wide or function-wide     | Varies; sometimes limited without custom configs      |
| Security Architecture           | Supports audit, compliance logging         | Often robust with configurable controls               |
| Flexibility                     | High, allowing cross-hierarchy access      | Medium to high, depending on system                    |

SAP’s Extended EH role stands out by combining hierarchical and RBP-defined access for tailored goal visibility and control.
