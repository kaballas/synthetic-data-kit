The user requested an extremely long, deep, and detailed report with emphasis on the last question, covering a large set of interrelated technical and security topics concerning Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) in IAM and SAML, the deprecation of SHA-1, its vulnerabilities, impact of SHA-1 removal on identity federations such as SAP Platform, procedural aspects around phasing out SHA-1, risks and challenges in migration, best practices, monitored auditing, and overall impact assessment and roadmap.

I will proceed step by step by gathering detailed focused information for each major query topic. I have preliminary data on SHA-1 vulnerabilities, its deprecation rationale, and some information on cryptographic migration. Next, I will research SAP-specific docs about ACS, SAP IAM and SHA-1 deprecation timeline, handling, and best practices for migration to SHA-256 and beyond.

For a comprehensive and structured report, I'll fetch authoritative technical data and vendor guidelines, including SAP’s own platform identity services, broader IAM industry practices, and historical precedents on SHA-1 sunset in federated identity frameworks.

First, I will gather relevant data on the technical function and significance of Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) within SAML SSO IAM systems, and details about SAP's implementation. Once I have that, I will continue on the next points.

## Deep and Detailed Report on SHA-1 ACS Deprecation in SAP Platform Identity Services and Related IAM Topics

### Technical Function and Significance of Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) in SAML-based IAM Systems

The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) is a critical endpoint within Service Provider (SP) systems in SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols. It is responsible for receiving and processing SAML assertions transmitted by the Identity Provider (IdP) after the user authenticates. Specifically, the ACS endpoint:

- Accepts the SAML Response containing the authentication assertion, signed digitally for integrity and authenticity.
- Validates the assertion’s signature and other attributes to ensure the user identity and authorization claims.
- Establishes a session for the user on the SP based on the validated assertion.

Technically, the ACS URL is specified in the SP metadata and must be registered with the IdP. The ACS is the gateway for federated authentication and establishes trust between identity federations. Its secure operation ensures seamless, trusted authentication flow without revealing user credentials to SPs.

### Security Implications and Vulnerabilities of SHA-1 Signing Algorithm and Its Deprecation

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is now considered broken due to demonstrated practical collision attacks where different inputs produce identical hash outputs. This undermines signature authenticity and enables adversaries to:

- Forge digital signatures on assertions or certificates.
- Conduct impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Undermine data integrity and non-repudiation guarantees.

Google researchers demonstrated feasible collision attacks generating two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash, showing it is no longer secure for cryptographic signing purposes. Industry standards such as those by NIST deprecated SHA-1 since at least 2014, recommending transition to stronger algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.

Major vendors including browser makers and Identity providers have stopped issuing or trusting SHA-1 signed certificates since around 2016-2017 to prevent fraudulent certificates and broken trust infrastructures.

### Effects of Deleting SHA-1 Signed ACS Entries on Federation Integrity and Recommended Alternatives

Deleting deprecated SHA-1 signed ACS entries in SAP’s Identity Platform directly impacts the trust fabric. It eliminates support for vulnerable cryptographic standards, thereby:

- Closing attack vectors from weak signature algorithms.
- Forcing federation partners to use stronger signing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256).
- Ensuring digital assertions remain authentic and secure.

Fallback recommendations generally promote using SHA-256 signing algorithms, part of SHA-2 family, which are currently industry standard for secure digital signatures and SAML assertions. SAP Product documentation aligns with these standards for continued secure SSO operations.

### SAP and IAM Providers’ Process for Identifying and Phasing Out Deprecated Cryptography

SAP and similar IAM providers apply structured lifecycle governance around cryptographic algorithms:

- Continual monitoring of cryptographic vulnerabilities and industry standards (e.g., NIST, IETF).
- Internal testing for compliance and interoperability.
- Issuance of notifications, warnings, and deadlines to customers well in advance (often 6-12 months).
- Providing migration guidelines with detailed technical steps and testing procedures.
- Gradual phased removal of deprecated algorithms with fallback support periods.
- Compliance mandates for customers often linked to support and SLA conditions.

Communication strategies include direct emails, portal notifications, technical webinars, and knowledgebase updates to ensure customers are aware and supported throughout the transition.

### Challenges and Risks in Migration from SHA-1 to SHA-256 in ACS Configurations

Service providers and relying parties face multiple risks during this migration:

- Interoperability issues where legacy or custom-built systems support only SHA-1 signatures.
- Access disruptions if federation partners fail to update their configuration before enforcement deadlines.
- Complexity in coordinating multi-vendor federated environments with varied upgrade schedules.
- Potential misconfigurations causing assertion validation failures or session errors.
- Impact on end-user experience due to authentication failures or need for re-enrollment.

### Best Practices for SAP Platform Customers to Identify and Remove SHA-1 Signed ACS Entries

SAP customers should follow these steps:

1. Audit existing ACS entries and associated certificates/signing algorithms.
2. Identify any ACS with SHA-1 based signing configured.
3. Coordinate with federated partners to update to SHA-256 or stronger algorithms.
4. Replace or update ACS metadata entries in SAP Platform accordingly before the deadline.
5. Perform integration and regression tests simulating SSO flows.
6. Use SAP platform validation tools or audit logs to confirm that ACS entries are no longer SHA-1 signed.
7. Monitor logs and alerts post-migration to quickly resolve any issues.

Validation tools may include SAP’s own identity service dashboards and third-party SAML testing utilities.

### Historical Lessons from Other SHA-1 Deprecations in Major IAM and SAML Federations

Historical precedents (e.g., major browser vendors phasing out SHA-1 certificates in TLS) show risks of rapid enforcement without adequate notice:

- User disruption from failed authentication or certificate errors.
- Delayed compliance by smaller or legacy providers causing gaps.
- Importance of long transition periods with clear milestones.
- Community collaboration and extensive documentation minimizing friction.

Models from these experiences stress proactive communication, automated tooling support, and fallback strategies.

### Monitoring, Auditing, and Incident Response Post SHA-1 Removal

Continuous compliance requires:

- Real-time monitoring of assertion signature algorithms in logs.
- Automated alerts on any use of deprecated algorithms.
- Regular audit reports verifying cryptographic standards.
- Incident response plans to quickly isolate and remediate misconfigurations or attacks exploiting legacy signatures.
- Use of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools integrating SAML assertion monitoring.

### Measuring Impact and Reporting to Stakeholders

Comprehensive impact measurement should include:

- Metrics on authentication failures and error rates.
- Security incident rates related to assertion forging or tampering.
- User satisfaction and access disruption surveys.
- Compliance status dashboards.
- Risk posture assessments quantifying improved cryptographic strength.

These reports help leadership make informed decisions on further security investments and compliance risks.

### Complete Detailed Assessment and Actionable Roadmap for SAP Platform SHA-1 ACS Migration by May 16, 2025

To ensure a smooth, disruption-free migration away from SHA-1 ACS entries, organizations should adopt this roadmap:

- **Now to 6 months before deadline:**
  - Inventory all SAML ACS entries with SHA-1 signatures.
  - Notify all internal and federated stakeholders about upcoming deprecation.
  - Start partner outreach to confirm SHA-256 readiness.
  - Update internal policies mandating SHA-256.

- **3-6 months before deadline:**
  - Begin testing SHA-256 signed assertions with federated partners.
  - Begin updating SAP platform metadata to remove SHA-1 ACS entries.
  - Conduct integration testing with fallback scenarios.
  - Provide training documentation to teams.

- **1-3 months before deadline:**
  - Complete migration of all ACS entries to SHA-256.
  - Validate all SSO flows, monitor logs for errors.
  - Engage SAP support for troubleshooting.

- **Post-deadline (after May 16, 2025):**
  - Continuously monitor for any SHA-1 signature attempts.
  - Audit compliance status monthly.
  - Follow incident response protocols for any security alerts.
  - Report impact and trends to stakeholders.

This ensures full cryptographic compliance, enhanced security resilience, and prevents any disruption in SSO functionality.
