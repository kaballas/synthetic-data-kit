## Career Worksheet Feature in SAP Opportunity Marketplace

### Definition and Purpose
The latest Career Worksheet feature in SAP’s Opportunity Marketplace is a structured, interactive tool designed to empower users by allowing detailed input of their career-related attributes including their skills profile, preferences, goals, and aspirations. It serves as a critical hub where employees can articulate core, critical, and passionate skills that the system uses to personalize career opportunity recommendations. The purpose is to create a more granular and dynamic user profile, enabling the platform to deliver highly relevant internal mobility and development recommendations aligned with the user’s career development plans.

### Architecture and Integration
Architecturally, the Career Worksheet is a modular component integrated within the Opportunity Marketplace landing page. It uses modern SAP SuccessFactors front-end frameworks (likely SAP Fiori UI5 technology) to embed an interactive worksheet with real-time data capture and validation features. The backend integration connects with SAP’s Talent and Career Development microservices repository, linking to an extensive skills ontology and master data system.

Functionally, the worksheet feeds into the recommendation engine as a primary data source. After the user completes or updates the worksheet, the captured data triggers server-side processing pipelines that refresh the role recommendation outputs on the landing page dynamically. It integrates via secure APIs with the recommendation microservice, enabling synchronous updates ensuring the opportunity cards and charts reflect the latest personalized insights.

## Baseline Role Recommendation Logic (Previous Version)

### Data Inputs
The baseline recommendation logic primarily ingests:
- Current job roles and job grades of the user.
- Explicit user preferences captured on the growth portfolio.
- Basic skills and competencies listed on the user profile.
- Historical interactions like past applications, interest signals, and bookmarks.

### Matching Algorithms
Originally, it leveraged rule-based filtering combined with basic machine learning ranking models. These models used similarity scoring based on skills overlap, career aspiration tags, and job roles within the employee’s current or higher pay grades. Collaborative filtering techniques considered indirect user preferences by learning patterns from peer behaviors.

### User Experience Design
The Explore Career Options section presented recommendations mostly as a simple ranked list or card-style feed. The interface allowed users to bookmark, express interest, or filter opportunities by job family and location, but offered limited interactive exploration beyond these facets.

### Output Quality
Output was relevant for general career transitions but suffered from lower personalization depth, often omitting nuanced skill preferences and lacking the granularity needed to support complex career paths or highly differentiated user interests.

## Enhancements with Latest Career Worksheet: Core, Critical, and Passionate Skills

### Incorporation Into Recommendation Logic
The enhancements introduced with the Career Worksheet center around explicitly integrating three skill dimensions:
- **Core Skills:** Fundamental abilities tied to the user’s current role and job family.
- **Critical Skills:** Strategic capabilities identified as essential for aspirational roles or future growth areas.
- **Passionate Skills:** Personal interests and competencies the user is enthusiastic about developing.

These skill categories are captured in the worksheet through structured input fields combined with validated skill taxonomy and proficiency levels.

### Algorithmic Modifications
The recommendation engine evolved from simple similarity models to a hybrid multi-dimensional matching algorithm that weights these skill dimensions differently based on the user’s input preferences and career objectives. Machine learning models now combine:
- Skills embeddings capturing semantic relationships between skills.
- Reinforcement learning that adjusts recommendation strategies based on feedback loops from user interactions.
- Multi-criteria decision-making frameworks to balance between current competencies, critical growth areas, and passion projects.

Data sources also expanded to include worksheet versions capturing user feedback, self-assessment scores, and validated skill endorsements, enriching the candidate profile used for recommendations.

## Operational Definitions and Validation of Skills

### Definitions and Categorization
- **Core skills** are derived from role-based competency frameworks that map to mandatory or baseline skills for current job levels.
- **Critical skills** arise from strategic workforce planning and are tagged by HR focus groups as essential for future roles or business needs.
- **Passionate skills** are self-reported and voluntarily entered via the worksheet, often aligned with informal learning interests or career aspirations.

### Quantification and Validation
SAP's talent ecosystem employs a blend of:
- Skill endorsements from managers and peers within the platform.
- Automated parsing of skills from learning activities, certifications, and project assignments.
- Periodic skill validation exercises and calibration via HR talent reviews.
- Integration of external validated data where available, such as certification bodies or L&D platforms.

## Models and Techniques for Synthesizing Skills and User Attributes

The enhanced recommendation system deploys:
- Embedding models to represent skills and their relationships in vector space for semantic similarity calculations.
- Gradient boosting or neural network-based predictive models that factor in experience, availability, career goals, and skills.
- Hybrid recommender system architecture combining content-based filtering on user attributes and collaborative filtering on similar user trajectories.
- Explainable AI components to provide rationale behind recommendations using skill and attribute importance scores.
- Continuous learning pipelines that update models as new user data and interaction feedback are collected.
