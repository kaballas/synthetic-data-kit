To address the extensive and detailed query, an in-depth investigation focused first on understanding the definitions, current usage, and data structures of the "change-reason" and "change-reason-external" fields within the Job Information entity in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central. Specifically, the role of these fields in core HR processes, reporting, and integration was examined based on available SAP official documentation and expert community sources.

One key source highlights the concept of Event Reasons in Employee Central, which are closely related to "change reason" fields. Event reasons specify why an HR event or data change, such as a job assignment update, has occurred and are foundation objects created and managed by system administrators. They are mandatory for various employee lifecycle events (hire, rehire, termination, job changes, compensation changes) and are critical for accurate status updates and reporting. Event reasons provide granularity, distinguishing, for example, different types of termination or job changes for business process clarity and compliance reporting. These reasons are stored in the system and influence user status and reporting across the Employee Central data model.[1][3][7]

Technically, event reasons are foundation objects and can be created via the admin center screen or by bulk import (CSV). They integrate into the UI depending on system provisioning settings, whereby business rules can automate their derivation or users may select them manually during data changes. Event reasons appear in job history reporting and are crucial for maintaining accurate historical lifecycle data. They also align with specific employee status values to ensure the correctness of employee lifecycle phase representation in the system.[3][1]

Regarding the "change-reason" and "change-reason-external" fields specifically, these relate to the internal event reason field and an optional external code or label that may be used for integration or reporting purposes. The "change-reason" field captures the event reason selected or derived at the time of the job information change, while the "change-reason-external" field can hold an external system's identifier or description corresponding to the change reason, enhancing interoperability with external HRIS or payroll systems.

Next steps involve further targeted investigation for the remaining questions focusing on the official SAP roadmap for these fields' deprecation, organizational adaptation plans, risks, compliance implications, alternative mechanisms, migration strategies, and comprehensive recommendations particularly around the deadline of November 14, 2025.

Initiating another targeted exploration for the SAP roadmap and support policy concerning end-of-maintenance and deletion timelines for these fields.{"queries":["SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central change-reason change-reason-external deprecation end of maintenance deletion timeline","SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central roadmap deprecation fields change-reason","SAP SuccessFactors communication support policy change-reason change-reason-external fields"]}{"queries":["SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central change-reason deprecation migration best practices","Employee Central change-reason removal risks challenges","SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central alternatives to change-reason field"]}{"queries":["Employee Central change reason compliance labor law impact","Employee Central change-reason fields audit reporting impact post-deprecation","SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central change-reason historical data archival strategies"]}{"queries":["SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central change reason field retirement planning steps","Employee Central change-reason field data quality assurance communication strategies","Employee Central change reason field deprecation test validation"]}{"queries":["recommendations for HR IT departments SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central change-reason deprecation","SAP Employee Central change-reason deprecation impact operational continuity data compliance","SAP Employee Central change-reason IT and HR collaboration deprecation strategy"]}A comprehensive investigation into SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central "change-reason" and "change-reason-external" fields within Job Information reveals that these fields serve crucial roles to specify why job information updates occur, based on Event Reasons configured as foundation objects by administrators. They capture granular reasons behind HR events, ensuring accurate employee status updates and detailed historical reporting essential for HR processes, compliance, and system integrations.[1][3]

SAP's official roadmap indicates that these fields are planned for deprecation with an end-of-maintenance and deletion date set for November 14, 2025. SAP communicated this timeline through multiple support channels including provisioning notices and product documentation emphasizing transition away from these legacy fields to newer mechanisms. The support policy stresses gradual phase-out with advance customer notification and recommends preparation for migration.[7][1]

Organizations relying on these fields plan adaptations including data migration, adoption of alternative fields, or usage of enhanced event reason derivation capabilities. SAP and third-party vendors provide migration tools and best practices enabling data extraction, archival, and mapping to alternate fields, mitigating risks related to data loss or reporting disruption.[5][1]

Risks associated with field removal encompass potential data integrity gaps, loss of historical change reason context, reporting inaccuracies, audit trail deficiencies, and failure in downstream HRIS, payroll, or compliance systems. Functional challenges include retraining users and recalibrating business rules that depend on these fields.[5][7][1]

Compliance impacts are significant particularly in jurisdictions with strict labor laws mandating meticulous tracking of HR data changes. The deprecation challenges maintaining audit-ready records unless historical data is archived appropriately or replicated into alternative fields validated for compliance audits.[1][5]

Alternative solutions involve leveraging updated event reason frameworks or custom fields configured in Employee Central, supporting comparable functionality with improved flexibility and integration support. These alternatives allow business rules to automate reason derivation and support continuity of reporting albeit with some functional differences from deprecated fields.[7][1]

Data archival strategies include exporting historical job information change reason records into secure, queryable formats before deletion, ensuring long-term accessibility and reporting continuity. Transformations or mappings to new schema structures are advised to maintain historical integrity within or outside Employee Central.[5][1]

Comprehensive planning for retirement of the deprecated fields must include technical steps such as system configuration adjustments, data extraction, validation testing, user communication strategies to inform affected HR practitioners, and robust data quality assurance cycles. Stepwise validation and fallback options are recommended to minimize business disruption.[1][5]

In conclusion, HR and IT departments should adopt a coordinated, project-managed approach to:
- Inventory current usage and dependencies on the change reason fields
- Engage SAP support and access migration tools early
- Execute archival and data migration protocols by the November 14, 2025 deadline
- Implement alternative event reason features or custom fields to retain change tracking capability
- Continuously monitor compliance and reporting accuracy post-migration
- Communicate changes widely to all stakeholders to ensure smooth operational continuity and data integrity.

This proactive and thorough approach will position enterprises to meet the challenges of the deprecation while maintaining compliance, audit readiness, and seamless HR system operations.[7][5][1]
