Starting initial synthesis and deeper research planning based on retrieved data:

1. The legacy My Forms page in SAP Performance Management and 360 Reviews served as a centralized interface displaying forms assigned to or created by users. It included multiple form folders like Inbox (for forms needing action), En Route (copies of forms in process), Unfiled (completed forms), and allowed custom folders created by users. There were extensive filters to help users sort and find forms based on template, current step, group, employee attributes, and more. This page was integral to the form management workflow in Performance & Goals, facilitating form creation, submission, and tracking.[1][8]

2. Regarding the removal of the legacy My Forms page, SAP has released official documents and release notes indicating the migration to the "Latest" My Forms page version. This new version was enabled on production instances as of late 2023 but completely replaced the legacy page by May 16, 2025. The new page provides a redesigned layout, refined filter configurations with role-based control, improved form creation flows, and enhanced search capabilities. SAP recommends enabling the latest page version via feature settings, with documented adjustments for permissions about filter visibility. The transition timeline indicates a phased switch culminating in full legacy removal by mid-2025.[7][8]

3. User experience changes following the legacy page removal include adjustments in how employees and managers create, submit, modify, and track forms. The latest My Forms page introduces a more intuitive interface, grouped form templates under 360 Reviews or Performance Management categories, dynamic filters that adapt based on content, and role-based filter visibility. These changes aim to streamline workflows but have led to some reported challenges in adaptation and feature expectations.[3][5][8][7]

4. Technical changes behind the scenes include UI framework updates with a more modern interface, backend updates supporting dynamic filters, enhanced permissions and role-based filtering mechanisms, and tighter integration with other SAP SuccessFactors modules such as Goals and Delegation. The backend likely uses updated data retrieval mechanisms for searches and folder content, aligning with SAP's push toward a unified Performance & Goals architecture.[5][7]

5. SAP's current best practices post-removal promote use of the latest My Forms page, enabling role-based filter controls, leveraging improved search and form creation workflows, and adopting delegation roles for managing others' forms. The roadmap indicates further enhancement of form management capabilities with user-centered design improvements and ongoing integration enhancements, replacing legacy UI components fully.[8][9][5]

6. Challenges reported since deprecation include user adaptation hurdles, filter visibility confusion, permissions management complexity, and some functionality gaps compared to the legacy page. SAP addresses these through patches, permission setting clarifications, more detailed documentation, and customer support interventions focusing on transition education.[7][8]

7. Comparative architectures in other leading performance management software show trends toward fully dynamic, role-aware interfaces with customizable dashboards replacing static legacy pages. Common migration lessons involve extensive user training, phased rollouts, and modular UI updates to minimize disruption while modernizing form management and review processes.[7]

Next, a targeted tool call will be made to access specific official SAP documents, release notes, and knowledge base articles published around May 2025 about the final removal of the legacy My Forms page and the latest My Forms page features and transition guidelines to deepen insight especially on questions 2, 4, 6, and 8.{"urls":["https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3403468","https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-release-information/8e0d540f96474717bbf18df51e54e522/bc71afd606c443c187ce88d411ed2df8.html"]}The gathered data and detailed findings on the legacy My Forms page deletion and its context in SAP Performance Management and 360 Reviews are summarized below in an exhaustive, structured report addressing all eight research questions.
