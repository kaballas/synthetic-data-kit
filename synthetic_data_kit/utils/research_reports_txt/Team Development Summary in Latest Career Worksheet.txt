## Career Worksheet Feature in SAP SuccessFactors (Latest Version)

The Career Worksheet in the latest SAP SuccessFactors version is designed as a tool within the Growth Portfolio to enable both employees and managers to manage and visualize career development paths effectively. It integrates functionalities to track current roles, target roles (aspirations), and skill development progress. Users can explore recommended roles through visualizations like card and chart views, which are based on skill ratings, job family data, and other personalized metrics.

Employees can see detailed information about roles, including job family context, incumbents, and organizational career paths, while managers have distinct access to a Team Development Summary that aggregates critical data on their team's career progress and development needs. Improvements in user experience and data accessibility have been emphasized in the latest releases.[1][3][5][7]

## Structure of Team Development Summary in Career Worksheet

Within the Career Worksheet, the Team Development Summary serves as a consolidated view for managers. The summary is structured into critical sections including:

- **Roles and Aspirations:** Displays team members' current job roles and the top three most popular target roles/aspirations within the team. This includes readiness levels for these roles and employee details.
- **Identify Skill Strengths:** Highlights the top five skills and attributes where employees meet or exceed expectations, enabling managers to drill down by selecting specific skills and tracking individual employee development over time.
- **Recognize Skills to Improve:** Shows the top five skill gaps relative to expectations for roles, guiding targeted development efforts.

The data is typically presented in a summary tab or dashboard-style format with interactive elements that allow filtering by role and skill criticality. Clear visualizations such as lists and charts enhance comprehension of team capabilities and gaps.[3][8][1]

## Data Sources and Integration for Team Development Summary

The Career Worksheet sources data primarily from:

- Employee role data and career aspirations recorded in SuccessFactors modules.
- Skill and attribute ratings gathered through performance reviews, assessments, and continuous feedback mechanisms.
- Organizational job family and career path frameworks defined within the SAP system.
- Integration with Talent Intelligence Hub and Growth Portfolio components that aggregate and personalize career path recommendations.

Data accuracy and currency are ensured through real-time updates from employee records, time-stamped skill assessments, and synchronization across SuccessFactors modules. Enhanced integration points enable mentors and managers to update development goals directly, improving the data's relevance and timely reflection of progress.[8][1][3]

## User Roles and Permissions Governing Access

Access to the Team Development Summary and Career Worksheet functionalities is controlled through defined user roles and permissions:

- **Managers:** Have permissions to view and manage the Team Development Summary for their direct reports, tracking career aspirations, skill growth, and development goals.
- **Mentors:** With specific mentor roles (e.g., mentor-MT), can manage development goals of their mentees within the worksheet context, allowing coupled mentoring and development planning.
- **Employees:** Can access their own career data, including roles, aspirations, and growth plans but do not see aggregated team data.

Role-based access ensures data privacy, limiting visibility to authorized users only and protecting sensitive personal and performance data while supporting collaborative career planning.[1][8]
