## Core Features and Functionalities of the New Learning Home Screen in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Apps

The new Learning home screen in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile apps (iOS and Android) introduces direct access to both mandatory and optional curricula, including sub-curricula, enhancing learner autonomy. Key features include intuitive navigation flow where learners can view their assigned curricula and optional learning paths immediately upon login. The design principles emphasize simplicity, clarity, and quick access.

- The home screen integrates tiles or cards representing curricula and sub-curricula, each expandable to show individual learning items or modules.
- Optional curricula are visually distinguished, allowing learners to explore additional learning opportunities beyond mandates.
- Navigation flows typically support single-tap access to curricula details, progress overview, and content launchability.
- The interface is designed responsively for both mobile platforms with consistent user experience and smooth integration with the broader SAP SuccessFactors ecosystem, reflecting synchronization with the desktop LMS environment and access to real-time learning data.

This mobile design facilitates dynamic learning by enabling learners to engage with optional content anytime, anywhere, thereby aligning with modern mobile learning demands.[1][10]

## Operation of Optional Curricula and Sub-Curricula within SAP SuccessFactors Learning

Optional curricula function as supplementary or elective learning paths assigned within or alongside mandatory learning structures. A sub-curriculum is essentially a nested curriculum within a main curriculum whose status may affect the main curriculum completion depending on configuration.

- Curricula comprise a sequenced set of learning items (courses, events, content).
- Optional curricula allow users to pursue more learning without mandatory completion deadlines.
- Sub-curricula dependencies define how completion in sub-curricula impacts main curriculum status often configurable to either require completion or treat as independent.
- Assignment logic includes criteria-based assignment via categories, user roles, job codes, or manual assignment by administrators.
- Mandatory items must be completed for curriculum completion; optional ones are tracked but do not block completion.
- Configuration options exist for recurrence, periods, and dynamic expiry of previous completions to maintain learner knowledge relevance.[3][5][7]

## Technical Mechanisms and Data Models Underpinning Mobile Access to Optional Learning

Mobile apps interact with SAP SuccessFactors backend through APIs supporting curriculum retrieval, assignment status, and content streaming.

- RESTful APIs expose curriculum structures, assignments, and learning content metadata.
- Synchronization mechanisms cache curriculum data locally on devices to optimize offline accessibility.
- Content delivery leverages adaptive streaming or downloading for mobile-friendly formats.
- User personalization is achieved via backend profile data integrated with mobile device authentication.
- Data models include curriculum objects, assignment profiles, and learning items linked with user profiles and progress states.
- iOS and Android apps handle caching differently but aim for parity in user experience.
- Robust synchronization ensures that progress completed on mobile or desktop reflects across platforms in near real-time.[10][1]
