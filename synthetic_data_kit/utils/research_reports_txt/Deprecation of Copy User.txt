## Report: Deprecation of Copy User Functionality in SAP SuccessFactors Learning

### 1. Overview: What is the "Copy User" functionality in SAP SuccessFactors Learning?

The "Copy User" functionality in SAP SuccessFactors Learning was originally inherited from Plateau, an LMS product acquired by SAP that served as the foundation for the early SuccessFactors Learning offering. Technically, the feature enabled administrators to duplicate an existing user's learning profile, including assigned courses, learning plans, and other relevant settings, to a new user. This capability was intended to simplify user onboarding and configuration by replicating complex user data quickly rather than manually recreating it.

Typical use cases included:
- Rapid creation of new learners with standardized learning assignments.
- Replication of learning paths for similar roles or job functions.
- Streamlining batch user setups where large groups required identical learning attributes.

Technically, it was accessed via an admin menu under Learning Administration → People → Users → Actions → Copy. Due to the legacy nature of the feature, it did not fully integrate with the modern SuccessFactors Learning architecture, especially identity and user provisioning frameworks.

### 2. Reasons for End of Development (EoD)

SAP officially announced the End of Development for Copy User on June 2, 2023, citing these main reasons:
- **Legacy Artifact:** The feature was a carryover from Plateau's LMS system, which SAP SuccessFactors Learning replaced with a new, modern platform.
- **Technical Incompatibility:** Copy User did not work correctly with SuccessFactors Learning's evolving data model and backend integration frameworks, especially the Identity Provisioning System.
- **Security and Data Integrity Concerns:** Maintaining a feature that duplicates user configurations posed risks since it was not aligned with current user lifecycle and governance best practices.
- **Effort Prioritization:** SAP chose to focus development resources on scalable, robust user provisioning APIs instead of maintaining outdated functionality.
- **Customer Feedback:** Some customers reported issues with inconsistent data replication and preferred modern identity management methods.

These factors, combined with the broader shift to cloud-native, API-driven LMS administration, pushed SAP to declare the feature obsolete and commence its deprecation.

### 3. Deprecation Timeline and Milestones

- **June 2, 2023:** Official End of Development (EoD) announcement. No new enhancements; bug fixes discontinued.
- **February 13, 2025:** Official deprecation notices widely communicated via SAP Help Portal and SuccessFactors community.
- **November 15, 2025:** Planned deletion and removal of the Copy User functionality from the platform. After this date, the feature and its UI elements will be completely disabled.

SAP has proactively communicated this timeline through release update notes, customer letters, and community forums to give organizations ample time to transition.

### 4. Alternatives and Recommended Processes

SAP advocates modern user management via:
- **Identity Provisioning Service (IPS):** Automated user creation, updates, and deactivation through standardized API calls and integrations with HR systems.
- **Learning Management System APIs:** Direct REST and OData APIs to programmatically assign courses and learning plans without user duplication.
- **Role-Based Assignments and Rules:** Create dynamic learning plans assigned based on roles/attributes rather than copying user states.

These alternatives offer better scalability, compliance, and accuracy than Copy User, though migration may require development effort and redesign of user provisioning workflows.

### 5. Impact on Customers

Deprecation affects:
- **Administrative Workflows:** Users who relied on Copy User for efficient user setup must adopt API-driven provisioning or manual configuration.
- **User Management:** More emphasis on source-of-truth integration (e.g., Core HRIS) for user data management and learning assignments.
- **Data Integrity:** Transitioning reduces risks of stale or inconsistent duplicated data but requires validation to avoid gaps.
- **Training and Support:** Admins will face a learning curve adopting new tools and processes.

Community forums highlight concerns about transition complexity and mapping prior user setups into new provisioning models.

### 6. Best Practices for Transition

- Early preparation by auditing current use of Copy User functionality.
- Develop and test API-based provisioning workflows in non-production environments.
- Train administrators on Identity Provisioning and learning API usage.
- Communicate changes proactively with internal stakeholders and learning users.
- Validate all migrated user assignments and learning records for completeness.
- Engage SAP support and leverage SAP community knowledge base for migration guidance.

### 7. Broader Trends in LMS Functionality

The removal of legacy features like Copy User reflects larger LMS industry trends:
- Shift away from manual or UI-only administrative tasks toward automated, API-driven processes.
- Enhanced data governance and security compliance demanding tighter user lifecycle controls.
- Vendors consolidating features to reduce legacy complexity, improve cloud-native capabilities.
- Increased use of role-based learning assignments versus ad-hoc user replication.

Comparatively, other LMS platforms such as Cornerstone OnDemand and Workday Learning have deprecated similar user duplication features favoring centralized identity and provisioning models.

### 8. Technical and Operational Consequences

- **Integrations:** Existing scripts or middleware invoking Copy User will break and require redesign.
- **Customizations:** Extensions dependent on user copying must adapt to new provisioning APIs.
- **Reporting:** Some historic learning assignments duplicated via Copy User may need reconciliation in reporting systems.
- **Operational:** Increased reliance on technical resources for provisioning and workflows previously managed through UI.

### 9. Comprehensive Adaptation Strategy

SuccessFactors Learning administrators should deploy a phased plan:
- **Phase 1 (Now to Nov 2024):** Assessment of current Copy User usage and inventory of impacted processes.
- **Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2025):** Development and validation of alternative provisioning workflows and API integration.
- **Phase 3 (Mid 2025):** Training and documentation for administrators and users.
- **Phase 4 (Sep-Nov 2025):** Parallel run and final cutover removing Copy User.
- **Post Nov 2025:** Monitoring and continuous optimization.

Communication plans should include detailed timelines, FAQ updates, and support channels.

### 10. Conclusions and Recommendations

- The Copy User feature was a legacy artifact no longer suited to modern SAP SuccessFactors Learning architecture.
- Its deprecation aligns with cloud LMS evolution favoring scalable, secure, API-driven identity and user management.
- Organizations must plan proactive migration away from Copy User to avoid operational disruptions by November 15, 2025.
- Cooperation with SAP support, utilization of Identity Provisioning, and robust change management are critical.
- Investing in training and API integration development will improve long-term administrative efficiency and compliance.
