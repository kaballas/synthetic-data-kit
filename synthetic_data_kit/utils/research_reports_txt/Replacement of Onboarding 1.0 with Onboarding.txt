## SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding 1.0: Features, Workflows, and User Needs

SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding 1.0 is a dedicated module designed to streamline and manage the critical early-stage employee integration processes after hiring. Its core purpose is aligning new hire engagement with organizational goals by automating the onboarding workflow, connecting stakeholders, and ensuring compliance and readiness before the employee's first day.

### Core Features and Functionalities

- **Intuitive Task Management:** Allows automated and configurable task flows for new hires and involved roles like HR and hiring managers.
- **Flexible Workflows:** Enables organizations to tailor onboarding steps, approvals, and checkpoints to meet specific business policies.
- **Legal and Corporate Forms Management:** Supports provisioning and secure handling of tax forms, verification documents (e.g., I-9), and corporate policies.
- **Pre-Day 1 Access:** Empowers hires with system access and learning resources prior to official start date for faster ramp-up.
- **Integration:** Seamless interoperation with SAP Recruiting Management and SAP Learning modules for smooth data transfer and development planning.
- **Secure Document Management:** Document Center facility for maintaining and delivering documents securely with role-based permissions.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Standard and customizable reports (e.g., E-Verify, signature transactions) for HR audit and compliance monitoring.
- **Multi-Language and Localization:** Adapt interface language and home page content to local contexts and regulatory needs.

### User Workflows Addressed

The onboarding process in Onboarding 1.0 follows a three-step default workflow:
1. **PostHire Verification:** Corporate representatives validate or input job-related data like salary, location, and provisioning, whether from recruiting data or manual entry.
2. **New Employee Step:** New hire completes personal and compliance information, tax forms, direct deposit, emergency contacts, and reviews corporate policies.
3. **Orientation Step:** Collaborative step where certifications, legal documents (e.g., Form I-9 Section 2), and training attestations are recorded.

This structured setup meets the needs of multiple stakeholders, ensuring timely and compliant processing of onboarding activities while enabling new employees to engage effectively from day one.[7][9][1]

## SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding 1.0 End of Maintenance and Deletion: Reasons, Timeline, and Official Communications

SAP has officially announced the end of maintenance and eventual deletion of Onboarding 1.0 by **May 14, 2026**. This sunsetting decision stems from strategic IT and business considerations:

- **Platform Consolidation:** The new Onboarding solution is built on the modern SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central (EC) platform. Maintaining Onboarding 1.0 alongside EC introduces architectural redundancy with dual corporate structures, security models, and data maintenance.
- **Reduction of Technical Debt:** Onboarding 1.0 operates on an older, standalone provisioning service requiring complex integrations and customizations that increase operational risk and costs.
- **Innovation Enablement:** SAP aims to focus development on a single integrated codebase that supports continuous feature enhancements, scalability, and tighter integration with broader SAP HXM modules.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Eliminating dual installations and maintenance cycles lowers customer administrative burden and license overhead.
- **Customer Communication:** Official SAP documents and partner advisories have conveyed the migration deadline and recommend proactive transition planning to mitigate risks of unsupported legacy software.[3][10]
