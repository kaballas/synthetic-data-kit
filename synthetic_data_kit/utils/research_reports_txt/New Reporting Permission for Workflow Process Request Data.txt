# Detailed Research Report on New Reporting Permission for Workflow Process Details in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central and People Analytics

***

## 1. Full Scope, Functionality, and Intended Use of the New Reporting Permission

A new reporting permission called **"Report Workflow Process Details"** was introduced in the **Manage Workflows** section of SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, effective with the 1H 2025 release. This permission is specifically intended to enable users to report on workflow process data within **Story Reports** in People Analytics, which was previously restricted. 

- Prior to this update, users required the broader **Manage Workflow Requests** permission to access workflow-related data in Story Reports.
- The new permission is granular and focused solely on reporting workflow process details rather than full workflow management capabilities.
- For existing users with Story reports utilizing workflow data, the new permission was automatically enabled to ensure backward compatibility.
- It is located under: **Administrator > Manage Workflows > Report Workflow Process Details**.
- The permission unlocks the ability to generate detailed analytics and reporting on workflow requests and their progress, suited for process monitoring, optimization, and compliance tracking.

Official source snippets:
- "Report Workflow Process Details â€“ now required to report on workflow process data in Story reports... anyone with existing Story reports using workflow data will automatically have this new permission enabled."[1]
- "We've added a new permission in the Manage Workflows section that enables you to report on workflow process details using Story reports."[8]
- "A new reporting permission 'Report Workflow Process Details' was introduced which is evaluated in story reports dealing with workflow requests."[7]

This marks a shift towards a more secure and role-based access control model specific to workflow data reporting.

## 2. Interaction With Existing Permissions and Security Roles

This new permission interacts with the existing Role-Based Permissions (RBP) framework for workflow management and reporting by carving out a specific scope for workflow data reporting:

- It **replaces** the need to have the broader **Manage Workflow Requests** permission for accessing workflow reporting data in Story Reports.
- The new permission is additive and must be assigned on top of existing workflow permissions to view workflow process details in analytical reports.
- Typical workflow permissions in Manage Workflows include approval roles, participant access, and field-level permissions controlled by RBP modules.
- The new permission grants **read/reporting rights only** for workflow process metadata, distinct from workflow execution or modification rights held by approval or admin roles.
- This separation allows use cases such as analysts or HR users generating workflow reports without having ability to act on or modify workflows.
- The permission respects existing field-level security, meaning users can only report on fields for which they have viewing permissions within the workflow context.

Summary:
| Aspect                         | Manage Workflow Requests Permission | Report Workflow Process Details Permission        |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Workflow process data viewing | Yes                                 | Yes, specifically for reporting in Story Reports |
| Workflow execution/approval    | Yes                                 | No                                               |
| Used in Story reporting        | Yes                                 | Yes, required for workflow data reporting         |
| Granularity                   | Broader                             | Fine-grained separate permission for reporting    |

## 3. Data and Metadata Accessible Through the New Permission

With this new permission enabled, users can access and report on comprehensive details of workflow processes, including:

- **Workflow Process Fields**: Includes status, request details, initiator, participant roles, approval steps, timestamps, modifications, and outcomes.
- **Workflow Stages**: Multiple phases or steps in a workflow process can be detailed in reports, capturing approvals, rejections, escalations, and notifications.
- **Report Types**: Story reports centered on workflow requests and process details can be created, offering timeline analysis, participant activity, and volume reporting.
- **Metadata**: Information such as workflow IDs, submission timestamps, user roles in the workflow, and process completion metrics.
- The permission supports reporting on all workflow-related data fields to which the user has field-level security access.
- Limitations noted: Users without this permission will find workflow process data unavailable or incomplete in Story reports; this denies visibility to sensitive or restricted workflow specifics.

This capability enables granular insights into workflows like leave approvals, employee data changes, role assignments, and more, supporting analytical use cases.

***

## 4. Technical and Functional Prerequisites and Configuration

To enable and effectively use this new permission, the following steps and considerations apply:

- **Configuration**: 
  - Assign the new **Report Workflow Process Details** permission role in Admin Center under the Manage Workflows section.
  - Ensure users requiring workflow data reporting in People Analytics Story Reports are assigned this permission.
- **Role Assignment Best Practices**:
  - Use RBP groups to assign permissions, combining with existing workflow participant roles.
  - Separate reporting roles from workflow approval roles for security and compliance.
  - Audit and test roles frequently to confirm correct scope.
- **Integration Points**:
  - The permission integrates tightly with Employee Central Master Data, as workflow requests correspond to employee lifecycle events.
  - It is also integrated with People Analytics module Story Reports framework, dependent on the permissions for analytics data model access.
- **Automatic Enabling**:
  - Existing users with reporting on workflow data in Story Reports automatically received this permission to preserve report functionality.
  
Guidance for setup and using this permission is included in product release documentation, SAP SuccessFactors administrator guides, and role-based security administration protocols.

## 5. Compliance, Data Privacy, and Governance Implications

The introduction of this permission impacts compliance and governance in the following ways:

- **Data Privacy**:
  - Allows tighter control of sensitive employee workflow data by restricting workflow process details only to authorized reporting users.
  - Limits risk of unauthorized data exposure in reports by enforcing explicit permission assignment.
- **Compliance**:
  - Supports organizational data governance policies by enabling audit trails on who accessed workflow process data.
  - Helps comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) through role-based access controls and minimized data exposure.
- **Governance Frameworks**:
  - Facilitates segregation of duties by separating reporting from approval roles.
  - Encourages transparency with controlled insight into workflow processes.
  - Enables governance teams to monitor workflow data usage and reporting against policy.

Overall, this permission enhances security and governance posture while enabling necessary reporting and analytics.
