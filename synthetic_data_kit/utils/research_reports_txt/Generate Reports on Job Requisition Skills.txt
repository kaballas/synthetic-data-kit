# Comprehensive Report on Job Requisition Skills and Priority Reporting in SAP People Analytics and Recruiting

## Fundamental Definitions and Components of Job Requisition Skills in People Analytics and Recruiting

In the context of People Analytics and Recruiting, job requisition skills denote the specific competencies, capabilities, and qualifications required to fulfill a particular job role effectively. These skills serve as critical filters and matching attributes when sourcing, screening, and hiring candidates. Fundamentally, they encompass technical skills, soft skills, certifications, experience areas, and even behavioral attributes that align with organizational needs.

Within talent acquisition frameworks used by SAP and similar platforms like SuccessFactors, these skills are traditionally identified through structured taxonomies and embedded in job requisitions via:

- Job descriptions and profiles
- Skills catalogs or universal skills taxonomies standardized across industries
- Automated extraction of skills from requisition texts using AI and NLP techniques

Skills are categorized into primary (critical to the role) and secondary (complementary) skills to prioritize candidate matching. SAP advances this by integrating AI-assisted skills validation, where recruiters can refine and augment skills lists dynamically for each job opening.[1][3][5]

## Prioritization Methodologies for Job Requisition Skills Across Organizations

Organizations prioritize requisition skills using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, including but not limited to:

- Stakeholder input from hiring managers, HR business partners, and subject matter experts to define critical skills
- Workforce analytics data capturing skill gaps, attrition, and business growth areas
- Data collection techniques such as job analysis surveys, employee skill assessments, and labor market intelligence
- Analytic models like predictive scoring of skills impact on job performance and hiring success
- Ranking frameworks embedded inside SAP Recruiting modules enabled by AI to categorize skills as primary or secondary dynamically based on historical recruiting success and organizational strategy

Industries vary in emphasis, e.g., tech sectors may prioritize emerging technical skills, while healthcare emphasizes certifications. Job levels influence prioritization—entry roles focus on core baseline skills, leadership roles prioritize strategic and leadership competencies.[3][1]
