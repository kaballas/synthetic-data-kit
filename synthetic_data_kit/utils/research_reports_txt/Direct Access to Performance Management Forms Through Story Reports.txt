# In-Depth Report on SAP People Analytics, Performance & Goals, and Story Reports Integration with Performance Management Forms

## 1. Key Components, Features, and Architecture of SAP People Analytics and Performance & Goals

SAP People Analytics is an integral reporting and analytics solution embedded within SuccessFactors, leveraging SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) technology to enable HR professionals to unlock insights and tell data-driven stories. In particular:

- **Performance & Goals** module: This manages employee performance data through goal setting, performance reviews, continuous feedback, and 360-degree evaluations.
- **Story Reports**: These are the modernized reporting format within People Analytics using SAP Analytics Cloud’s Story framework. A Story Report consists of multiple segments—charts, tables, text, and visualizations—that present HR data in a structured, interactive, and customizable manner.
- **Underlying Architecture**: People Analytics uses live data connections or cached data models via OData services or SuccessFactors Reporting (SAPSFSFREP). It operates within SAC, which provides visualization, data modeling, and user interactivity capabilities. The architecture supports role-based access control with SAP Cloud Identity Authentication Services (IAS) for secure, SSO-enabled user access.

### Performance Management and Story Reports Functionality

- The Performance Management (PM) data includes review forms, goal attainment, and related activities.
- Story Reports do not embed PM forms directly as editable interfaces but consume PM data for analytical purposes.
- Forms from PM are linked or accessed externally from story reports via deep links or external URLs.
- Reporting queries use data schemas like SAPSFSFREP, encompassing audit trail, goal management, and 360 feedback schemas.

## 2. Structure and Technical Capabilities of Story Reports in SAP Analytics Cloud

- **Stories** in SAC are multi-page documents with segments containing visualizations bound to data queries.
- Each segment may be configured with input controls (filters, dropdowns) for dynamic data exploration.
- Data sources are queries built on SuccessFactors HR schemas.
- Story embeddability limitations: Complex transactional forms like PM forms cannot be natively rendered with full interactive editing experience inside Story widgets.
- **Deep linking and embedding**: Possible via hyperlinks, iframe embedding (limited in cases for security and session management), or custom URL parameters pointing to a form or dashboard in the PM module.
- **Data refresh and interactivity**: Story queries execute live or on schedule and support drill-down for detailed insights.
- Story reports are accessible via Report Center with management functionalities like scheduling, sharing, and exporting.

## 3. Official SAP Methods for Direct Access/Deep Linking to PM Forms from Story Reports

- SAP’s recommended approach involves generating dynamic URLs (deep links) from Story Reports to specific PM forms based on employee and review cycle context.
- Deep links are constructed using system-provided URLs with embedded parameters such as user ID, form ID, and performance period.
- Configurations must enable sharing and access control alignment, usually requiring:
  - **SAP Cloud Identity Authentication Services (IAS)** for SSO.
  - Proper role-based permissions in SuccessFactors (PM and Story report access).
  - Administrative setup for URL generation and embedding in Story Reports.
- No direct public API renders PM forms inside SAC widgets; instead, OData services and metadata provide data used for reports, while navigation to forms is handled via deep link URLs.
- Use cases include launching forms for completion, review, or print preview triggered by Story report user actions.
- Dynamic URL generation often combines query result data with URL templates configured in the reporting layer.
