Starting the deep and extensive research process. I will first summarize and dive into technical details and vulnerabilities of HTTP Basic Authentication for API access, then proceed step-by-step through other aspects including SAP ecosystem specifics, deprecation policies, alternatives, and more. Let's begin by dissecting Question 1 in full technical depth.

### 1. HTTP Basic Authentication in API Access: Principles, Technical Implementation, Use Cases, and Vulnerabilities

**Fundamental Principles and Technical Implementation:**

HTTP Basic Authentication is an authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. It is a simple encoded challenge-response mechanism used to transmit credentials (username and password) from client to server securely over HTTP. The client sends an "Authorization" header with each HTTP request in the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
```

Here, `<credentials>` is the Base64-encoded string of `username:password`.

- This mechanism operates at the HTTP protocol layer.
- Encoding is not encryption, so the credentials can be easily decoded if intercepted.
- It requires the server to authenticate the user credentials for each HTTP request.
- Typically, the HTTP 401 Unauthorized status is used with a `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate that authentication is required.

**Typical Use Cases:**

- Basic Authentication is often used for internal APIs, development environments, or legacy systems where simplicity is preferred.
- It is frequently paired with HTTPS to provide encryption of credentials in transit.
- Some automated tools and scripts relying on straightforward authentication employ Basic Authentication due to its ease of implementation.

**Known Security Vulnerabilities:**

- Credentials are sent in every request, increasing exposure if the connection is compromised.
- Base64 encoding is not encryption — credentials can be decoded trivially.
- If not used over HTTPS, the credentials are sent in plaintext, vulnerable to interception.
- Susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks if TLS is not enforced.
- Lack of protection against replay attacks or session fixation.
- Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) since there are no inherent protections.
- Does not support multi-factor authentication or granular token expiration controls.
- Typically, passwords are static and hard to rotate without service disruptions.
  
**Comparison to Other Authentication Methods:**

| Aspect                   | HTTP Basic Authentication              | OAuth 2.0                         | API Keys                    | JWT (JSON Web Tokens)                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Security of credentials   | Base64 encoded (not encrypted)       | Token-based, encrypted and scoped| Token/key, opaque             | Token-based, signed and optionally encrypted |
| Transport requirement    | Requires HTTPS for security          | Requires HTTPS                   | Requires HTTPS (recommended) | Requires HTTPS (recommended)       |
| Session management       | Stateless, credentials sent each request | Stateful or stateless            | Stateless, no session         | Stateless with expiration built-in |
| Complexity               | Very simple                         | Complex, requires authorization flows | Simple                       | Moderate complexity                |
| Usability                | Easy to implement                   | More user-friendly token management | Simple                      | Convenient for SSO and scalability|
| Granularity              | No scope or limited control          | Fine-grained scopes and permissions | Limited                      | Fine-grained claims and scopes      |
| Vulnerability to attacks | High if HTTPS not enforced, CSRF    | Mitigates many attacks with token management | Medium; key leakage risk     | More resilient but requires secure storage |

Overall, Basic Authentication is the simplest but least secure method and mostly obsolete for public-facing or sensitive API integrations.[3][5][7][8][10]
