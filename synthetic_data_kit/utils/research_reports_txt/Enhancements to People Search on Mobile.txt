## Core Features and Functionalities of People Search on Mobile Platforms

People Search in enterprise mobile apps, such as SAP's platforms, traditionally centers on enabling users to quickly and accurately find organizational contacts, colleagues, or relevant personnel profiles. Core features typically include:

- **Keyword-Based Search Bar:** Users input names, job titles, skills, or organizational units.  
- **Filter and Sort Capabilities:** Narrow search by departments, locations, roles, availability, or expertise areas.  
- **Profile Access:** View detailed employee profiles including contact info, hierarchy, skills, and recent activity.  
- **Integration with Corporate Directory APIs:** Sync with backend identity management and HR databases for real-time data.  
- **Contact Actions:** Ability to initiate communication (call, email, chat) directly from the profile.  
- **Offline Caching:** Limited profile data caching for availability without network connectivity.  
- **Security and Access Controls:** Role-based access restricting sensitive info visibility per user permissions.  
- **Multi-language Support:** Accommodate global organizations with multilingual profile fields and search adaptability.  

Implementation of these features involves close integration with enterprise identity management systems (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory), secure backend APIs (OAuth 2.0, JWT), and platform-native UI/UX components for seamless cross-device experience.

These elements together ensure users can engage with an intuitive and secure People Search feature optimized for mobile contexts, balancing data richness with app performance and responsiveness.[1][3]

## UX and Performance Metrics for Evaluating People Search

Evaluation of People Search improvements hinges on comprehensive UX and performance metrics:

- **Search Speed (Latency):** Time from query input to visible results; sub-second response times are industry goals.  
- **Accuracy and Relevance:** Precision@K metrics assess how many top results are relevant; recall measures coverage of correct matches. User satisfaction surveys gauge perceived relevance.  
- **Result Completeness:** Whether search returns comprehensive profiles matching various query types.  
- **User Engagement:** Number of searches per session, feature utilization rates (filters, sorting).  
- **Error Rate:** Incidence of failed searches, no results returned, or incorrect hits.  
- **Device Resource Usage:** Memory, CPU impact, and battery consumption during search operations.  
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Measured by compatibility with assistive technologies, usability by people with disabilities.  

Benchmarks come from industry standards in mobile app search and enterprise software UX. Google, Microsoft, and SAP internal frameworks often set targets like 300-500 ms for query response, 90%+ relevance in top 5 results, and above-average user satisfaction scores in feedback tools.[3][9][10]
