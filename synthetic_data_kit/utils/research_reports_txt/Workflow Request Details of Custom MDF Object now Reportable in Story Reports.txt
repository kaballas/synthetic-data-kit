## 1. Custom MDF Objects in SAP Employee Central: Definition and Configuration

Custom MDF (Metadata Framework) objects in SAP Employee Central are user-defined business entities created using the platform’s Metadata Framework to extend standard Employee Central data models without coding. These objects allow organizations to capture additional employee data or business scenarios tailored to their needs.

- **Definition and Configuration**  
  Custom MDF objects are defined via the Admin Center under "Configure Object Definitions." When creating a custom object, a unique code starting with "CUST_" is used. The object consists of multiple fields specifying the data to be collected, their data types, and validation rules. Objects can be effective-dated, meaning data is linked to start and end dates for historical tracking. Configurations include API visibility settings (e.g., Editable) for integration purposes and associations with other MDF objects or standard entities.  
- **Pending Data Field Role**  
  The "pending data" field, configured on the Object Definition page, is critical for workflow integration. Setting this field to "Yes" enables the system to capture workflow request details related to the custom MDF object. It allows the object instance to hold data in a "pending" state during approval processes before finalizing changes. This is essential for reporting on the workflow lifecycle and request status data, as only with this enabled are detailed workflow records available for reporting.

***

## 2. Workflow Requests Structure and Purpose for Custom MDF Objects

Workflow requests in Employee Central represent approval processes triggered by changes or creations of custom MDF object data. They manage data validation, authorization, and compliance within HR operations.

- **Structure**  
  Workflow requests capture metadata such as request ID, initiator, timestamps, status (pending, approved, rejected), and the specific actions taken within the approval process. For custom MDF objects, workflow requests include data snapshots before and after change, comments, approver information, and audit logs.  
- **Data Captured**  
  Detailed information includes the actual pending data changes (enabled by the pending data field), effective dates for changes, workflow steps/status, and history. This structure supports transparency and traceability of HR data changes.

## 3. Story Reports in SAP People Analytics for MDF Objects and Workflow Requests

Story Reports are a core reporting tool in SAP People Analytics that enable HR professionals to visualize and analyze data from Employee Central MDF objects and workflows.

- **Functionality and Reporting Capabilities**  
  Story Reports allow building customizable dashboards and visualizations with access to MDF object fields, including workflow request details where configured. Reporting on workflow requests involves accessing data models that store workflow metadata and pending data fields. Users can drill down on request status, approval chains, field-level changes, and timelines.  
- **Technical Prerequisites and System Settings**  
  Reporting on MDF workflow requests requires enabling the pending data field in the MDF Object Definitions, activating relevant APIs/integration points for workflow data extraction, and ensuring proper data synchronization between Employee Central master data and People Analytics data models. Permissions must be configured to allow analytics access to workflow request data.

***

## 4. Configuration Steps and Settings for Workflow Request Reporting in Story Reports

- **Enable Pending Data Field**  
  In Admin Center → Configure Object Definitions, edit the custom MDF object, and set the "pending data" field flag to "Yes." This setting ensures the system logs detailed data changes during workflows.  
- **Permissions and Role Setup**  
  Assign necessary Permission Roles that include "Metadata Framework" and related access to workflow data. Without these roles, reports won’t access workflow request fields.  
- **Data Model Synchronization**  
  Confirm the MDF object and associated workflow request data replicate into the People Analytics data warehouse or HANA views mapped in Story Reports. This may involve scheduled data loads or real-time API integration configurations.  
- **Report Design**  
  In Story Reports, use data sources that include both the MDF object fields and workflow request entities, joining them on object and request IDs to report full workflow lifecycle details.

## 5. Limitations, Constraints, and Best Practices in Workflow Request Reporting

- **Data Volume and Performance**  
  Workflow request tables can grow significantly, impacting query times. Best practice includes filtering reports on date ranges, request status, or specific employees to maintain performance.  
- **Refresh Frequency**  
  Depends on integration architecture; nightly batch updates are typical though near real-time may be enabled. Reports should be designed with the expected data latency in mind to avoid stale data presentation.  
- **Complexity of Data Models**  
  Complex MDF objects with multiple associations and effective dating require careful join logic in reports to avoid inaccurate data aggregation or duplication. Pre-aggregated views or calculated columns in data models often improve usability.  
- **Data Accuracy**  
  Reporting on pending workflow data must handle scenarios with simultaneous workflows and cancellations carefully to reflect true current data, necessitating robust business logic and validation.

## 6. Integration of Employee Central MDF Workflow Data and People Analytics Story Reports

- **Data Model and API Level**  
  Data from Employee Central MDF objects and their workflows are brought into People Analytics through standard SAP integrations using OData APIs and enterprise data warehouse replication. The workflow request data lives alongside MDF object data in integrated HANA views or composite data sources consumed by Story Reports.  
- **Troubleshooting**  
  Common issues include missing workflow data due to lack of pending data flag, improper permissions, incomplete data replication, or incorrect join keys in reports. SAP recommends verifying MDF object definitions, data provisioning logs, role access, and data dictionary mappings when workflow data is absent in reports.

## 7. Examples and Use Cases from SAP Documentation and Community

- SAP documentation and community posts provide various examples of custom MDF object creation and enabling workflow request reporting, including detailed walkthroughs of setting the pending data field, configuring workflows, and creating Story Reports with workflow data inclusion. Recent SAP releases introduced enhanced workflow analytics features allowing better drill-down and separation of workflow steps.  
- Use cases include onboarding approvals, employee data change requests, and compliance audit dashboards showcasing status and audit trails of MDF object changes.

## 8. Visualization, Filtering, and Analysis for Actionable Insights

- **Effective Visualization**  
  Use Story Reports to create timeline visualizations of workflow request statuses, heat maps of approvals by department, and KPI cards for approval times and rejection rates.  
- **Filtering**  
  Common filters include request status, initiation date ranges, approval groups, and employee demographics, enabling focused analysis.  
- **Recommended Metrics and Dimensions**  
  Metrics: request volume, average approval time, rejection count, and pending requests.  
  Dimensions: employee ID, department, workflow step, request initiator, and effective dates.

## 9. Security and Data Governance Considerations

- Ensure user roles in People Analytics restrict access to workflow data by defining granular permission roles with access to MDF workflow entities only when appropriate.  
- Workflow request data often contains sensitive employee information; compliance with GDPR and data privacy regulations requires masking or anonymization capabilities and audit logging of report access.  
- Use SAP SuccessFactors role-based permission framework to enforce least privilege principles for analytics and reporting users.
