To address the comprehensive and deep research request on the SAP Employee Central "View leave balance" functionality and its latest enhancements in September 2025—especially focusing on the integration with SAP Business AI and comparing with other HR platforms—several key details and technical aspects have been gathered from the latest sources. Below is a structured and detailed report answering all 10 questions thoroughly.

## 1. Fundamental Components and Features of "View leave balance" in SAP Employee Central (2025)

The "View leave balance" functionality in SAP Employee Central enables employees to access their current leave entitlements across various leave time types, such as annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, and unpaid leave. The key components include:

- **User Experience:** Employees access the leave balances through the self-service portal or mobile app. The interface presents leave balances as of the current date, with drill-down views by specific leave time types. Employees can see available balances, earned but unused leave, planned absences, and any manual adjustments. The UI is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and integrates calendar views for leave planning.
  
- **Data Sources:** Leave balances come from SAP Employee Central’s Time Management module, pulling real-time data from employee time accounts and absence records. It reflects accruals based on time profiles configured per company policy and regional labor laws, updated with any manual adjustments or overrides entered by HR.

- **Typical Use Cases:** Employees check their balances before requesting leave, HR administrators verify leave entitlement during audits, and managers use it to approve leave requests knowing the current balance status. Integration with payroll ensures leave balances impact salary calculations for paid/unpaid leave.

This functionality is essential for transparency, compliance with labor regulations, and effective leave planning.[1][3][7]

## 2. Integration with SAP Time Management and Employee Central: Data Models & Algorithms

"View leave balance" tightly integrates with:

- **SAP Time Management:** This module stores detailed absence and attendance data including leave accrual rules, time types, quota accrual cycles, and adjustment transactions. It uses a well-structured data model where time accounts represent accumulations of leave entitlements tied to employee profiles.

- **Employee Central:** Serves as the single source of employee master data and work schedules. The time account balances are calculated dynamically pulling from real-time transactional data.

- **Data Models:** Include:
  - Time Account Types (annual leave, sick leave, etc.)
  - Time Types (specific absence categories)
  - Balance Calculation Settings (accrual rules, retroactive adjustments)
  - Time Profiles for accrual frequencies and eligibility criteria.

- **Algorithms:** The system applies business rules for leave accruals, which consider periodic accumulation, manual and automatic adjustments, and future bookings (e.g., planned absences). The September 2025 update introduced enhanced balance calculation settings that consider future negative bookings when calculating current balance, ensuring consistency between time account and time type balances.[3][1]

## 3. September 2025 Update: Precise Changes and Enhancements

The September 2025 update introduced key enhancements:

- **Time Type View:** Users can now check leave balances by specific time types (e.g., annual leave, sick leave) directly within the view. Previously, leave balances were aggregated and less granular.
  
- **Future Booking Consideration:** The balance calculation setting for time account types now allows consideration of future negative bookings such as planned absences and negative manual adjustments when calculating current leave balance. This results in a more accurate and consistent leave balance display.

- **SAP Business AI Integration:** The update includes capabilities leveraging SAP Business AI to provide predictive insights and personalized leave recommendations, improving user experience and planning accuracy.

- **Technical Improvement:** This update shifted balance calculation methods to a setting "Consider bookings after calculation date," harmonizing time type and account balances. It enhances data integrity and reflects real-time planning implications.[8][1][3]

## 4. SAP Business AI Leveraging Machine Learning for "View leave balance"

SAP Business AI in the September 2025 "View leave balance" enhancements uses AI/ML techniques to:

- **Provide Insights & Predictions:** AI models analyze historical leave patterns, individual employee behavior, and organizational leave trends to predict future leave needs and potential availability conflicts.
  
- **Personalized Recommendations:** The system can suggest optimal leave timings based on workload, team schedules, and leave policies, helping users plan better and reduce last-minute leave conflicts.

- **Proactive Alerts:** It generates alerts for leave balance anomalies or nearing expiry of leave quotas, assisting employees and HR in managing leave effectively.

- **Data Privacy and Compliance:** AI features comply with GDPR and other regional data privacy laws. Employee data used in AI models is anonymized or pseudonymized where needed, and processed within secure SAP cloud environments adhering to compliance standards.[8]
