## SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Mobile Services Architecture, Core Capabilities, and Role in Mobile Application Development and Authentication

SAP BTP Mobile Services is a cloud-based platform as part of SAP Business Technology Platform that provides comprehensive services to build, deploy, run, and manage mobile applications with enterprise-grade capabilities including offline support, push notifications, security, analytics, and identity management.

### Architecture

- BTP Mobile Services is designed as a cloud-native platform enabling mobile developers to connect apps with backend systems securely.
- It supports integration with SAP and third-party systems through APIs and microservices architecture.
- The platform consists of backend services (mobile backend, identity management, push notification services), front-end SDKs for iOS and Android, and management tools in SAP BTP cockpit.
- It leverages SAP's Cloud Identity services for authentication via multiple identity providers.
- SDKs incorporate offline data synchronization, secure storage, and token management.

### Core Capabilities

- App lifecycle management: Build, test, configure, deploy, and monitor mobile apps.
- Enterprise security: Role-/user-based access control, data encryption, secure authentication, and token management.
- Identity and access management: Supports OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, integrating with enterprise identity providers for Single Sign-On (SSO).
- Push notifications and in-app messaging.
- Analytics and usage reporting.
- APIs for data synchronization and remote configuration.

### Role in Mobile Application Development and Authentication

- Provides a centralized identity service that securely authenticates users accessing SAP applications including SuccessFactors mobile apps.
- Enables simplified and secure authentication workflows with token-based access aligned to industry standards.
- Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) integration through identity providers.
- Facilitates seamless SSO experiences across SAP and non-SAP systems.
- Supports app activation, onboarding, and management with device-specific policy enforcement.
- SDKs abstract authentication complexities and provide secure token storage and renewal mechanisms.

## Authentication Mechanisms Supported by SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Apps on iOS and Android, and Their Technical Operation

SAP SuccessFactors Mobile apps support several authentication mechanisms to securely validate users:

1. **Company Credentials with Web Login Password**
   - User enters corporate username and password during activation.
   - The app communicates via REST APIs to SuccessFactors backend for authentication.
   - Password policies (length, complexity, history) enforced by system administrators.

2. **Mobile App Password**
   - During activation, users set a separate app password if enforced by company policy.
   - The app requires this password each launch or resume, protecting the local app.
   - Supports password history and complexity policies.

3. **Biometric Authentication**
   - Uses native device biometrics: iOS Touch ID, Face ID; Android Fingerprint.
   - Biometrics serve as an alternative to app password, enabled optionally.
   - Operates by leveraging device biometric APIs, not transmitting biometric data externally.

4. **Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0 or OAuth**
   - Supports browser-based SSO, redirecting to corporate identity providers.
   - Uses SAML responses or OAuth tokens to grant access.
   - The app relies on embedded or external browsers for authentication handshake.

5. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Integrates with MFA configured in corporate environment.
   - Commonly includes One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS, email, or authenticator apps.
   - Ensures additional security layer post primary authentication.

6. **Device Activation Methods**
   - Includes Search-Based Activation, Email-Based Activation, MDM-Based Activation, and QR Code Activation.
   - Activation securely associates device to a user with enforced auth policies.

Technically, these mechanisms interplay with the SAP SuccessFactors backend via secure HTTPS with OAuth tokens or SAML assertions. The app maintains tokens, refreshes them as needed, and enforces local app lock (via app password or biometrics) for runtime security.

## Integration and Enhancement by BTP Mobile Services in Authentication Workflow of SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Apps

Integrating BTP Mobile Services extends and secures the authentication process in the following ways:

- **Centralized Identity Management**: BTP Mobile Services acts as an identity broker between the mobile app, SuccessFactors backend, and external identity providers, simplifying complex auth workflows.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: The app authenticates via OAuth 2.0 tokens issued by BTP Mobile Services. Tokens encapsulate permissions and session state.
- **Identity Verification**: Users authenticate using configured identity providers (IdPs) such as SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS), corporate SAML IdPs, or social IdPs. BTP validates the tokens.
- **Token Management**: BTP securely issues, refreshes, and revokes access and refresh tokens, ensuring session continuity and controlled access.
- **Enhanced MFA**: BTP can enforce MFA policies during token issuance, integrating corporate MFA systems transparently.
- **Secure Communication**: All interactions use encrypted HTTPS channels, and tokens are stored securely in mobile SDKs.
- **Token Exchange and Single Sign-On**: The integration supports token exchange to access multiple SAP systems with one authentication, enabling seamless SSO.
- **Device Management and Policy Enforcement**: BTP Mobile Services can enforce app security policies like device compliance, expiration, and forced logout through policy configuration.

The technical workflow involves:

1. User initiates login on the mobile app.
2. The app redirects authentication to BTP Mobile Services.
3. BTP triggers authentication via configured IdPs.
4. Upon successful login, an OAuth token is issued to the app.
5. The app uses the token to access SuccessFactors data.
6. Tokens are refreshed transparently for session maintenance.
7. User logout triggers token revocation and session end.

## Configurations and Prerequisites in BTP Mobile Services for Secure Authentication of SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Apps

- **Subscription to BTP Mobile Services** and proper entitlements.
- **Configuration of Identity Providers in BTP**: Register enterprise IdPs (e.g., SAP IAS, corporate SAML) for OAuth and SAML-based authentication.
- **App Registration in BTP Mobile Services**: Define the app with required scopes, redirect URIs, and platform-specific parameters.
- **OAuth Client and Scopes Setup**: Create OAuth client credentials with scopes that allow access to SuccessFactors and other backend APIs.
- **MFA Policy Configuration**: Define MFA requirements linked to applicable IdPs.
- **Mobile App SDK Integration**: Embed BTP Mobile Services SDKs in iOS/Android apps with proper configuration files and API keys.
- **Security Policies Setup**: Configure password policies, biometric options, device compliance, data encryption, and token lifetimes.
- **Network and Firewall**: Allow mobile app and BTP services endpoints to communicate securely, including with the corporate IdP.
- **Testing Environment Setup**: Provision test identities, configure sandbox environments matching production settings.
- **Activation Method Enablement**: Enable activation flows such as QR code, email, MDM activation, supported by BTP.
- **Logging and Monitoring Setup**: Activate audit logs, error reporting, and monitoring dashboards in BTP cockpit.
