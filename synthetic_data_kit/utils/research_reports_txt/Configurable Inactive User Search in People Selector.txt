The initial web search has returned multiple relevant sources that help answer the detailed queries about SAP Goal Management's People Selector, especially regarding the "Include inactive users in search results" option, its functionality, configurations, and implications across modules and organizations. Below is a structured and extensive report compiled from these findings.

## Functionality of People Selector in SAP Goal Management

The People Selector in SAP SuccessFactors Goal Management is a key interface component on the landing page of the latest Goal Management module, designed to facilitate user search and navigation to goal plans within an organizational hierarchy. It primarily allows users to:

- Search for people by name.
- View organizational relationships such as Matrix Manager/Report relationships.
- Access goal plans of directly related users (managers, direct reports, matrix reports).
- The People Selector panel opens by default on accessing the Goals page.
- The list within the People Selector incorporates pagination to allow viewing more users.

Search functionality depends on the logged-in user's role-based permissions, specifically "User Search" and "Goal Management Access," which control who can be searched and which goal plans can be accessed. The permissions model further restricts actions and visibility on target users' goals based on XML field and action permission configurations. Notably, peers are excluded in the People Selector in some releases, emphasizing hierarchical navigation rather than lateral peer access.[1][5][10]

## Configuration of "Include Inactive Users in Search Results"

The configuration setting "Include inactive users in search results" controls whether inactive employees appear in People Selector search results. This option was historically enabled by default and visible to all users irrespective of roles. Recent updates allow administrators to configure the visibility and enablement of this option based on organizational policies and roles, providing more flexible user experience management.

Technical mechanism:

- The toggle controls a filter within the People Selector search query that either includes or excludes users flagged as inactive in the system.
- Visibility and accessibility to this toggle itself is now controlled by role-based permissions.
- If enabled and visible, users can actively choose to include inactive users in search results.
- If disabled or hidden, only active users appear, and inactive users are excluded from search, simplifying search results.

UI Implications:

- When enabled, the search results become broader and may include former employees or terminated users.
- When disabled, search results are cleaner, focusing on current employees only.
- The option's visibility can be turned on/off in the People Selector panel on the landing page, improving interface simplicity or comprehensiveness as required.[3][7][9]

## Organizational Scenarios for Including Inactive Users

Including inactive users in People Selector searches is beneficial in several organizational contexts, particularly in areas like:

- **Talent and Career Development:** To access historical goal plans for inactive individuals for reference, auditing, or succession planning.
- **Performance Management:** Managers or HR teams may need access to inactive users’ historical performance and goals for evaluation, disputes, or compliance.
- **Compliance and Auditing:** Organizations may need to retain visibility of inactive users for legal and regulatory reasons (e.g., past performance reviews, audit trails).
- **Rehire Scenarios:** When former employees might be reinstated or considered for rehire, their goal and performance records are accessible.

In these cases, including inactive users supports comprehensive career documentation and decision-making reflecting past and present workforce data.[7][1]

## Cross-Module Impacts of Including/Excluding Inactive Users

The People Selector’s inactive user inclusion setting influences several interconnected SAP modules:

- **Performance & Goals:** Inactive users’ past goal data and performance ratings may be visible or hidden, influencing reporting, calibration, and historical reviews.
- **Succession & Development:** Succession planning may require review of inactive users’ data for rehiring or reassigning roles, impacting talent pool visibility.
- **Career and Talent Development:** Access to inactive user data ensures continuity in career development tracking, useful in analytics and gap identification.

Excluding inactive users simplifies interfaces but risks losing access to essential historical data needed in these workflows, possibly degrading decision quality or compliance adherence. Including inactive users increases data volume and complexity but preserves comprehensive data integrity across modules.[1][7]

## Best Practices and Known Pitfalls in Configuration

Based on SAP documentation and community insights, best practices include:

- **Role-Based Control:** Limit inactive user visibility to HR and managerial roles to prevent unnecessary clutter for regular users.
- **Clear UI Indications:** When inactive users are included, visually differentiate them in lists to avoid confusion.
- **Audit and Compliance Alignment:** Align inactive user visibility with organizational policies on data retention and auditing.
- **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust the inclusion setting based on organizational changes.
- **Avoid Search Overload:** Be cautious about enabling inactive user searches in large organizations, as it may impact search performance and user experience.

Pitfalls:

- Inclusion without role restrictions can overwhelm users with irrelevant search results.
- Lack of clarity on inactive status can cause operational confusion.
- Ignoring compliance may lead to data retention violations.[3][7]

## Industry and Organizational Variations

Different industries and organizational sizes approach inactive user inclusion differently:

- **Large Enterprises:** Often require inclusion to manage extensive historical data for compliance, audits, and talent tracking.
- **Regulated Industries (Finance, Healthcare):** Typically include inactive users to meet strict data retention and auditing standards.
- **Mid-sized and Smaller Organizations:** May prefer exclusion to simplify interfaces and reduce administrative overhead.
- **Dynamic Workforce Industries (Retail, Hospitality):** May benefit from inclusion due to frequent rehiring and transient employment.

Metrics or KPIs guiding these decisions include:

- Search query performance statistics.
- User feedback on search accuracy and relevancy.
- Compliance audit requirements.
- User activity logs indicating demand for inactive user data.[7][3]

## Impact on End-User Experience, Data Accuracy, Compliance, and Reporting

Including inactive users affects:

- **User Experience:** More comprehensive search results but potentially increased complexity and data volume.
- **Data Accuracy:** Ensures complete historical data is accessible, improving accuracy in reports and decisions.
- **Compliance:** Supports adherence to data retention laws (GDPR, labor regulations) by maintaining visibility of all relevant personnel records.
- **Reporting:** Allows inclusion of historical performance and goal data for longitudinal analyses.

Excluding inactive users streamlines the interface but may limit visibility necessary for full compliance and comprehensive reporting.[3][7]

## Strategic Recommendations for Configuration

Based on the comprehensive analysis:

- Organizations should align the inactive user inclusion setting with their talent management policies, compliance requirements, and operational needs.
- Adopt role-based visibility to restrict inactive user search option to HR, managers, and relevant users.
- Utilize inactive user inclusion primarily for audit, development history, and succession planning contexts.
- Ensure system users are trained to understand the inactive user status and implications.
- Monitor key metrics such as search performance, user satisfaction, and compliance audit results to tune the setting over time.
- Regularly update and patch SAP Goal Management to leverage latest features and improvements for inactive user management.

This balanced approach optimizes end-user usability, operational efficiency, and compliance adherence in SAP Goal Management’s People Selector.[7][3]
