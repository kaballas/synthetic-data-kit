## Table Reports in SAP People Analytics: Detailed Research Report

### Core Functionalities, Features, and Use Cases of Table Reports Leading up to November 2023 End of Development

Table Reports have been a fundamental feature within SAP SuccessFactors People Analytics, providing users with the ability to generate structured, tabular data extracts and formatted reports from multiple SAP SuccessFactors modules (Employee Central, Performance, Goals, Succession, Recruiting, etc.). They support both simple lists and advanced data manipulations such as cross-tabs and pivots to analyze workforce data comprehensively.

Key features of Table Reports included:

- Support for complex queries combining multiple data schemas and fields across SAP modules.
- Ability to export report outputs in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint) aiding offline analysis and distribution.
- Role-based access management ensuring data privacy compliance.
- Integration into People Analytics Report Center, a unified platform centralizing report creation and execution.
- Use cases largely revolved around HR workforce metrics tracking (headcount, diversity, performance KPIs), compliance audits, and operational workforce planning.

Leading up to the End of Development announcement in November 2023, Table Reports were increasingly seen as legacy reporting tools within the People Analytics suite. SAP encouraged migration towards more modern, dynamic, interactive analytic tools including Story Reports and dashboards powered by SAP Analytics Cloud integration, which promised advanced visualizations, predictive analytics, and improved user experience.

The evolution showed a trend from static list-based reporting to narrative-driven, interactive reporting, embedding storytelling elements alongside tabular data to enhance insight communication.

### Official Rationale and Strategic Context for End of Development and Planned Deletion

SAP’s official rationale for the End of Development and planned deletion of Table Reports stemmed from multiple strategic and technological factors:

- **Modernization Drive:** SAP aimed to consolidate reporting capabilities around next-generation BI technologies like SAP Analytics Cloud. Table Reports, while functional, lagged in interactivity, visual appeal, and predictive analytics integration.
- **User Feedback:** Feedback indicated many users desired richer insights with better visualization and storyboarding capabilities, which Table Reports could not provide effectively.
- **Product Roadmap Realignment:** SAP’s broader strategy realigned People Analytics towards cloud-first, AI-enhanced analytical offerings with integrated planning and simulation tools.
- **Technology Trends:** Increasing emphasis on data governance, real-time analytics, and seamless cloud integration made legacy reporting formats less suitable.
- Internal assessments indicated maintaining multiple overlapping reporting technologies was inefficient, leading to product simplification by deprecating older features not matching modern standards.

SAP communicated the End of Development as a planned step to encourage customers to transition to newer platforms with greater functional breadth and alignment with SAP’s analytics ecosystem.

### Alternatives to Table Reports and Their Comparison

SAP recommended several alternative reporting tools and methodologies within People Analytics and related SAP analytics offerings:

| Alternative Tool         | Features and Benefits                                                     | User Experience            | Integration                    | Data Handling                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Story Reports (People Stories)** | Interactive narrative-style reports, combine charts, tables, and storytelling, designed for strategic insights | Highly engaging, non-technical friendly | Deep integration with SAP SuccessFactors data and SAP Analytics Cloud | Support for complex cross-module data with dynamic filtering and interactions |
| **Dashboards & Tiles**   | Summarized snapshot reports with drill-downs, interactive filters         | User-friendly, real-time view | Integrated in Report Center and SAP Analytics Cloud | Handles large datasets with real-time refresh |
| **SAP Analytics Cloud**  | Advanced BI platform with predictive analytics, planning simulations      | Modern BI UX with drag-and-drop report building | Native integration with SuccessFactors and other SAP systems | Strong data governance and governance capabilities |
| **Report Center**        | Central hub consolidating multiple report types, including table and story | Unified interface, improved management | Supports all SAP SuccessFactors modules | Streamlined data access with role-based permissions |

Compared to Table Reports, these alternatives offer:

- Enhanced interactivity and visualization.
- Better alignment with strategic decision-making and predictive insights.
- Superior cloud-native architecture enabling agile reporting workflows.
- More holistic integration for multi-source data blending.

### User Community and Industry Expert Reactions

The deprecation announcement sparked mixed reactions:

- **Concerns:** Many users dependent on legacy Table Reports expressed concern about the effort needed to migrate complex, customized reports and possible loss of granular control.
- **Acceptance:** Industry experts generally supported SAP’s modernization stance but emphasized the importance of smooth migration paths and sufficient support.
- **Requests:** The community called for robust transition guides, training, and assurances around feature parity before final retirement of Table Reports.
- Feedback forums and SAP user groups reflected anxiety about impacts on operational reporting continuity but optimism about the potential of more advanced, user-friendly analytic capabilities.

### Implications of Withdrawal of Deprecation Announcement

SAP’s withdrawal of the planned November 2025 deletion brought important technical, operational, and business implications:

- **Technical:** Continued support and maintenance of Table Reports for the foreseeable future, ensuring stability for existing workloads.
- **Operational:** Relief for users not yet ready to migrate, giving them additional time to plan transformations without sudden disruptions.
- **Business:** Reflects SAP’s willingness to listen to customer feedback and adopt flexible product lifecycle management, potentially revising their modernization pace.
- SAP communicated transitional support and consultancy options to assist customers with eventual shifts to newer technologies while preserving legacy reporting capabilities in parallel.

### Broader Trends in Enterprise Analytics and People Analytics

The lifecycle of Table Reports mirrors broader enterprise analytics trends emphasizing:

- Shift from static, batch reporting to real-time, interactive analytics.
- Adoption of cloud-native BI platforms offering predictive and AI-driven capabilities.
- Increasing focus on data governance, secure role-based access, and data privacy in workforce analytics.
- Integration across HR, finance, and operational data sources to provide cohesive insights.
- Move towards self-service analytics models empowering business users with minimal IT dependency.

### Lessons in Product Management, Communication, and Change Management

Key lessons from SAP’s handling include:

- Importance of clear, early communication of product lifecycle changes to manage expectations.
- Need for offering robust migration paths, tools, and training to ease customer transitions.
- Value in flexibility, shown by withdrawal of deprecation when broad customer impact was recognized.
- Enhancing collaboration with user communities to co-develop roadmaps and listen to concerns.
- Balancing innovation with legacy support to maintain trust and customer satisfaction in enterprise markets.

### Strategic Guidance for Organizations Using Table Reports
