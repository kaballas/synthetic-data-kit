## Functionality and Scope of Employee Central Quick Actions in SAP SuccessFactors

Employee Central Quick Actions are designed to simplify HR tasks by providing immediate, role-specific access to predefined, commonly used employee self-service (ESS) and manager self-service (MSS) actions within SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central (SF EC). The core purpose is to enhance efficiency, accessibility, and user experience by enabling users to quickly execute targeted HR transactions without navigating complex menus.

### Core Features
- Quick, templated access to specific HR actions (e.g., updating personal information, job details, or emergency contacts).
- Support for both standard and custom fields, allowing customization for country/region-specific or company-specific data needs.
- Templates can include up to 8 fields per use case to maintain simplicity and usability.
- Role-specific permissioning ensures users only see actions relevant to their role (employee, manager, or HR admin).
- Inclusion of effective date fields for changes to be tracked precisely.
- Available on multiple platforms: web desktop browsers and native mobile applications on iOS and Android.

### Typical Use Cases
- Employees updating emergency contacts, personal addresses, or ID information.
- Managers initiating new hire processes or job transfers quickly.
- HR teams approving or managing data changes efficiently through streamlined access.

### Supported Platforms
- Desktop: Accessible through web browsers with full UI capabilities.
- Mobile: Native apps for iOS and Android, optimized for touch and smaller screens with streamlined UI and action flows.

These quick actions align with SAP's commitment to employee-centric, mobile-first, and efficient HR service delivery.[1][3]

## Attachment Integration in Employee Central Quick Actions

Attachments are integrated into the Quick Actions framework primarily to support document uploads required during HR processes such as ID verification, certification submissions, or other employee document needs.

### Technical Specifications
- Supported attachment types: PDF, JPG, PNG.
- Maximum file size per attachment: 10 MB.
- Multiple attachments can be handled depending on the scenario and template configuration.
- Attachments are securely stored with encryption both at rest and during transit.
- Attachment fields need to be explicitly included and configured within the Quick Action templates to enable upload.

### User Interface Changes on Mobile
To support attachment uploads on mobile devices:
- A dedicated attachment upload button is added within the Quick Action form.
- Uploaded attachments display as thumbnails or previews inline for user confirmation.
- Users can select files from device storage or capture photos (mobile camera integration).
- The mobile UI maintains simplicity to ensure quick and error-free uploads, with progress indicators and validation feedback.

This integration ensures mobile users can complete HR transactions requiring documentation directly within the Quick Actions, eliminating cumbersome multi-step processes and improving self-service adoption .
