## Legal Entity Transfer Definition and Scope in SAP Onboarding

Legal Entity Transfer (LET) in SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding refers to the process of transferring an existing employee from one legal entity within an organization to another legal entity, either within the same country or across countries. This involves terminating the employeeâ€™s current employment and creating new employment records for the receiving legal entity. SAP triggers onboarding during this process to manage the transition of the employee to the new legal entity, ensuring compliance with organizational, HR, and legal frameworks governing employment transitions.

LET use cases include internal-employee rehires for mobility across legal entities, restructuring, mergers/acquisitions requiring legal employment reassignments, and international transfers with compliance needs for local employment laws and benefits regulations.

The governance of LET lies within HR frameworks related to employment contracting, labor laws for termination and rehiring, data privacy laws concerning employee data transfer, and internal corporate policies managing employee status, payroll integration, and benefits continuity. The process must be designed to adhere to these multifaceted legal and HR compliance requirements around employment status changes and onboarding formalities.[1][3][6]

## Procedural Workflows and System Configurations in LET (Before Manage Pending Hire)

The LET process can be initiated from SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting or external Applicant Tracking Systems by triggering a "Rehire with New Employment" workflow. Key prerequisites include a future termination date on the old employment record, immediately followed by a future start date for the new employment in the receiving legal entity.

The step-by-step workflow includes:

1. Termination of current employment with a future termination date.
2. Initiation of rehire with new employment process.
3. Skipping typical rehire checks in SAP for LET to streamline the process.
4. Assignment of new employment profile and contractual details in the target entity.
5. Initiation of Onboarding workflows including the Manage Pending Hire process.
6. Task assignments, approvals, and new hire data reviews.
7. Email notification to the employee with new employment welcome details, leveraging configured templates.
8. Synchronization of employee master data between Employee Central and Onboarding.
9. System configurations include enabling "Rehire with New Employment", setting business rules for handling legal entity updates, configuring onboarding process variants, and employment profile selections for internal hires.

Critical system points involve business rules to enforce new employment creation on entity transfer, data validation checkpoints surrounding termination and start dates, and process variant management for workflows specific to LET.[3][5][6][1]

## Manage Pending Hire Step: Technical and Operational Details

The Manage Pending Hire step is a pivotal checkpoint post-LET initiation and before the new employment start date activation. Technically, MPH acts as a data validation and finalization process ensuring all required onboarding tasks, approvals, and compliance forms are completed before the employee can officially start in the new legal entity.

It performs stringent validations on critical employee data, employment contract details, compliance document completion (e-signatures, tax forms, benefits elections), and synchronization of employee status across systems. Operationally, it acts as a gatekeeper preventing premature activation of employee status that may cause payroll, benefits, or legal compliance failures.

Completion of MPH is mandatory to finalize the onboarding journey and "activate" the new employment in SAP Employee Central. Until MPH is completed, the employment remains in a pending or inactive state, preventing discrepancies such as start date misalignments or inaccurate employment status. This requirement ensures organizational readiness, data integrity, and compliance prior to an employee officially assuming their new role.[4][8][1][3]

## Impacts and Challenges in Employee Start Date Synchronization and Employment Status

Organizations face multiple challenges syncing employee start dates and employment status during LET transitions, particularly with pending hires:

- Misalignment of termination and start dates causes inactive employee states or data inconsistencies.
- Outsourced payroll, benefits, and time management systems may experience delays or errors if employee data is incomplete or pending.
- Compliance risks arise from incorrect tax withholdings, benefits eligibility, or labor law adherence due to asynchronous data states.
- Employee experience suffers from login access issues, fragmented communication, or task completion delays.
- Organizations must carefully coordinate termination workflows, onboarding tasks, and system integrations to minimize disruptions.
- Onboarding process delays, especially in MPH completion, can negatively impact legal compliance and payroll accuracy.[8][1][3]

***

## Variations Across Industries and Regions

LET and pending hire handling varies significantly across industries and regions due to:

- Differential labor laws and social security regulations requiring localized onboarding documentation or eligibility criteria.
- Industry-specific compliance mandates, e.g., healthcare or finance requiring added background checks or certifications during onboarding.
- Localization in SAP including language packs, date/time formats, and region-specific regulatory field validations.
- Payroll and benefits systems integrated vary by region, necessitating customization in data mapping and synchronization.
- Multinational organizations may customize rehire and onboarding workflows to accommodate multi-country legal entity structures and employment types.[6][9][1]

## Metrics, Audit Logs, and Reporting Mechanisms

SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding provides audit logs, status tracking dashboards, and reporting tools to monitor LET and MPH progress, including:

- Task completion statuses and pending outstanding tasks.
- Time-to-complete reports measuring delays in onboarding steps including MPH.
- Workflow audit trails recording approvals, data changes, and compliance checkpoints.
- Alerts and notifications for overdue onboarding tasks.
- Reporting on employee activation status post-MPH and overall LET cycle times.
