### 1. Features and Functionalities of Full Profile in SAP People Profile

The Full Profile in SAP’s Latest People Profile consolidates comprehensive employee data into a single, organized interface accessible by employees, managers, and HR administrators. It presents the data through multiple "cards," each describing a specific employee data set grouped logically into categories for easy navigation. 

- **Data Cards and Components**: Cards act as snapshots of data, with detailed drill-down views for each card element. Categories group cards by HR data domains like Personal Data, Job Data, Compensation, etc.
- **Predefined and Custom Cards**: SAP delivers predefined cards based on core HR data (including Employee Central and MDF objects). Administrators can create custom cards and categories to include specialized or client-specific data.
- **Date-based Viewing**: Users can select a specific effective date to view employee data reflecting the status at that point in time.
- **Multiple Access Points**: Full Profile is accessible via global search, profile preview pages, Spotlight, and the main navigation menu for People Profile.
- **Role-based Access**: Displayed data respects role-based permissions ensuring compliance and security, with specific access rights needed for inactive employee profiles or other sensitive info.
- **Migration and Co-existence**: Enables seamless migration from legacy People Profile layouts and supports coexistence with prior profile views such as Profile Preview and Spotlight.

These core features establish Full Profile as a comprehensive, flexible, and role-sensitive data hub for HR operations.[1][3][7][9]
