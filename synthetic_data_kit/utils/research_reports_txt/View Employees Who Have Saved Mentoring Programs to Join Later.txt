## Report on "Saved for Later" Tab in SAP Career and Talent Development Mentoring Programs

### 1. Key Functionalities and Features in the "Saved for Later" Tab and User Roles

The "Saved for Later" tab is part of the Manage Mentoring Programs interface in SAP SuccessFactors, a module under the broader SAP Career and Talent Development suite, aligned with the Succession & Development product suite. This tab serves as a repository where employees can bookmark mentoring programs they are interested in but wish to join at a future date.[1][7]

**Key Functionalities:**
- **Listing Saved Programs:** Displays mentoring programs the employee has earmarked for later participation.
- **Easy Access to Enrollment:** Allows employees to quickly access and join programs without re-searching.
- **Status Tracking:** Employees can track status updates for saved programs (e.g., open enrollment, filling phases).
- **Administrative Oversight:** Mentoring administrators and program owners can view who has saved programs, enabling targeted communication or proactive engagement.

**User Roles and Permissions:**

- **Mentoring Administrators:**
  - Have broad system permissions to create, manage, and close mentoring programs.
  - Can view aggregated and individual data related to saved mentoring programs.
  - Have admin-level rights to control participant enrollments, program configurations, and permissions.
  - Can monitor saved programs to assess employee interest and engagement patterns.
- **Program Owners:**
  - Owners manage specific mentoring programs assigned to them.
  - They have visibility into saved participants for their programs and can initiate matching or communication workflows.
- **Employees (Participants):**
  - Can save mentoring programs for future joining.
  - Have personal dashboards reflecting saved programs, matching statuses, and historical participation.
  - Permissions are limited to view programs available to them based on role-based access control and target populations.

The role-based permissions in SAP SuccessFactors are managed via Role-Based Permissions (RBP) and Metadata Framework (MDF) objects, ensuring controlled access to employee data and program details.[1]

### 2. Data Structure and Storage of Employees’ Saved Mentoring Programs

The underlying data structure supporting the "Saved for Later" feature integrates with SAP’s Talent Management data models hosted on SuccessFactors Platform. Key components include MDF objects, relational database tables, and secure oData API access layers.[5][1]

- **MDF Objects:** Mentoring programs and employee interactions (including saving programs) are represented as MDF entities. This allows program metadata and saved status to be maintained flexibly within the platform.
- **Database Schemas:** Employee saved states are typically stored as relationships or entity instances linking employee IDs to mentoring program IDs with metadata on the saved date and status.
- **Integration Points:** The saved program data is accessible via SAP SuccessFactors APIs for real-time consumption by UI components and reporting modules. The Metadata Framework ensures updates sync across modules like Career Development Plans, Learning, and Succession Planning.
- **Data Storage:** Data objects for mentoring participation records differentiate between mentee, mentor, owner, and administrator roles, preserving historic sign-up forms, statuses, and associated interactions for auditability and longitudinal tracking.[3]

### 3. Standard Workflows and User Interaction Paths

**Employee Interaction:**
- Browse mentoring programs.
- Use the "Save for Later" feature to bookmark programs.
- Receive status notifications about the program (e.g., open enrollment dates).
- Join when ready or as enrollment opens.

**Administrative and Owner Interaction:**
- Access the "Saved for Later" tab to review potential participants.
- Use saved data for targeted communications or invitations.
- Monitor saved program trends to anticipate demand.
- Update program statuses and manage participant matching dynamically.

**Notifications and Status Updates:**
- System triggers notifications to employees about program status shifts (e.g., start/end of enrollment phases).
- Administrators receive alerts on saved metrics, enabling engagement or adjustments to program delivery.
- Automatic status transitions in supervised and unsupervised programs guide both participants and administrators through the mentoring lifecycle.[8]

### 7. Comparison with Other Mentoring and Talent Platforms

Compared to other major mentoring software solutions:

| Aspect                 | SAP Career and Talent Development                           | Other Platforms (e.g., MentorcliQ, Chronus)                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Design         | Integrated within broader talent ecosystem (Succession & Development, CDP) | Often standalone mentoring platforms.                           |
| User Experience        | Role-based, centralized within SAP SuccessFactors UI       | May focus more on ease of use and gamification for engagement. |
| Data Handling          | MDF-driven, API-accessible, integrated with employee master data | Varies, some with proprietary databases, limited integration.  |
| Reporting & Analytics  | Embedded enterprise-grade reporting, AI insights emerging  | Often specialized dashboards with customizable analytics.      |
| Program Management     | Supports supervised, unsupervised, and open enrollment models | Similar flexibility but often less tightly integrated.         |

SAP's strength lies in enterprise integration, while other platforms may offer more dedicated mentoring user experiences.[8][7]
